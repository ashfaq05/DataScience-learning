    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is NumPy?\n",
    "\n",
    "It stands for \"Numerical Python\". `NumPy` is a Python module that provides fast and efficient array operations of **homogeneous data**. It is the core library for scientific computing in Python providing a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is one of the many packages that is extremely essential in your data science journey, because this library equips you with an array data structure that offers some benefits over the traditional data structures of Python like lists.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NumPy Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "The central feature of NumPy is the array object class, also called the **ndarray**. Arrays are very similar to lists in Python, **except that every element of an array must be of the same type** (in lists you can hold data which have different types), typically a numeric type like `float` or `int`. It is very much similar to a n-dimensional matrix which looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='../images/31.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays make operations with large amounts of numeric data very fast and are generally much more efficient than lists. You can chose to create arrays of *n* dimensions (Python list is an array of pointers to Python objects, at least $4$ bytes per pointer plus $16$ bytes for even the smallest Python object; $4$ for type pointer, $4$ for reference count, $4$ for value  and the memory allocators rounds up to $16$. A NumPy array is an array of uniform values -- single-precision numbers takes $4$ bytes each, double-precision ones, $8$ bytes). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating NumPy arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax of creating a NumPy array is:\n",
    "\n",
    "`numpy.array(object, dtype = None, copy = True, order = None, subok = False, ndmin = 0)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the arguments \n",
    "\n",
    "- `object`: Any object exposing the array interface \n",
    "- `dtype`: Desired data type of array, optional\n",
    "- `copy`: Optional. By default (true), the object is copied\n",
    "- `order`: C (row major) or F (column major) or A (any) (default)\n",
    "- `subok`: By default, returned array forced to be a base class array. If true, sub-classes passed through\n",
    "- `ndim`: Specifies minimum dimensions of resultant array\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets see how you can create a simple array using NumPy by first importing the package `numpy as np`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "a = np.array([1,2,3,4])               # creates a 1-dimensional array\n",
    "b = np.array([[1,2,3,4], [5,6,7,8]])    # creates a 2-dimensional array\n",
    "print(a)\n",
    "print('----')\n",
    "print(b)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Its output will be\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[1 2 3 4]\n",
    "----\n",
    "[[1 2 3 4]\n",
    " [5 6 7 8]]\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of using NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "- Absolutely free since open-sourced \n",
    "- Faster access in reading and writing items\n",
    "- Time and space complexity of tasks is much lower when compared with traditional data structures\n",
