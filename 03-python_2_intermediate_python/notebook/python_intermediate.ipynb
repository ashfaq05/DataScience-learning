    "\n",
    "In data manipulation and analysis, you will often come across reading and writing files. Python can handle files of different types including `txt`, `JSON`, `HTML`, `CSV` etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets look at the pipeline to handle file operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Open the file\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets say that you have a text file named `months.txt`. How to open this file? We use the `open()` function to open files and its syntax is given below:\n",
    "\n",
    "**`open(file, mode='r', buffering=-1, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None, closefd=True, opener=None)`** \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "You can open the file passing the `path` argument to the `open()` function. Here, `file` is the file path of the file `months.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you may want to use the file plainly for reading but in some cases you may want to modify it also. For this purpose, use the argument `mode`to chose how you want to treat the file object. Below are some of the mode options:\n",
    "- `'r'` : use for reading\n",
    "- `'w'` : use for writing\n",
    "- `'x'` : use for creating and writing to a new file\n",
    "- `'a'`: use for appending to a file\n",
    "- `'r+'` : use for reading and writing to the same file\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Read the file\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step you read the contents of the file. It can be done in several ways:\n",
    "- **`<file>.read()`**: It returns the entire content of the file as a single string.\n",
    "- **`<file>.readline()`**: It returns the next line of the file, returning the text up to and including the next newline character. Simply put, this operation will read a file line-by-line.\n",
    "- **`<file>.readlines()`**: It returns a list of the lines in the file, where each item of the list represents a single line.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Write to a file\n",
    "\n",
    "To write to a file use **`<file>.write()`**. The `write()` method does not add a newline character ('\\n') to the end of the string. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Close the file\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Python automatically closes a file when the object reference changes, it is considered a good practice to close the file. It keeps our data safe and nothing could access the data which makes it safe. \n",

    "- **`Exceptions`**: An exception is a Python object that represents an error. If the normal flow of the program gets disrupted inspite of being syntactically correct, Python raises an exception; which if not handled properly, the program will terminate. **Remember that exceptions always occur at run-time.** Python comes with various built-in exceptions as well as the possibility to create self-defined exceptions which we will be discussing in the upcoming topics.\n",
