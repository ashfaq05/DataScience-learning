    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Before even diving into what does version control system stands for, lets take a scenario where you must have unknowingly cooked up your own version control system! \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**SCENARIO**\n",
    "\n",
    "In a directory you have the following files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Important_first.txt**\n",
    "- **Important_march.txt**\n",
    "- **Important_june.txt**\n",
    "- **Important_august.txt**\n",
    "- **Important_december.txt**\n",
    "\n",
    "Looks familiar? What is happening here you have modified the initial file **Important_first.txt** and modifed it and saved them as its modified/updated versions. The month names were added after *_* symbol so that you can track/retrieve those versions using a clever alibi (month of the year).\n",
    "\n",
    "Pretty cool right! You have now successfully created a system by means of which you can track and retrieve versions of the files over time. This is what a **Version Control System** does. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why need a Version Control System?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This scheme of renaming the files seems to be performing well to your requirements. But this manual process of tracking files by renaming will be a very painful task especially if that is a software project containing hundreds of thousands of files. Large, fast-changing projects with many authors need a Version Control System to track changes and avoid general chaos. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario without Version Control System**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a situation where there is a team of 4 people developing a software without using a version control. Since they have tasks assigned, they will do some contributions, make some code and merge it. \n",
    "<img src='../images/vcs.gif'>\n",
    "As in the image, lets say that Bob finishes a module, then Carol also finishes her module, when they combine let’s say some merge conflicts arise (for now, you can imagine merge conflicts as some problems in merging the code or integration of modules), then Alice also finishes the work allotted and tries to merge and then Ted also completes his portion of work and tries to integrate. \n",
    "You can easily imagine the mess that is created. To prevent situations like these, version controls are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Functions of Version Control System**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the most basic and important functions that a Version Control Syste, does are:\n",
    "- **Backup and Restore**: Files are saved as they are edited, and you can jump to any moment in time. Need that file as it was on last month? No problem.\n",
    "- **Synchronization**: Lets people share files and stay up-to-date with the latest version.\n",
    "- **Short-term undo**: Playing around with a file and messed it up? (That’s just like you, isn’t it?). Throw away your changes and go back to the *last known good* version.\n",
    "- **Track Changes**: As files are updated, you can leave messages explaining why the change happened (stored in the VCS, not the file). This makes it easy to see how a file is evolving over time, and why.\n",
    "- **Track Ownership**: A VCS tags every change with the name of the person who made it. Helpful for giving credit.\n",
    "- **Sandboxing**: Making a big change? You can make temporary changes in an isolated area, test and work out the kinks before incorporating your changes.\n",
    "- **Branching and merging**: A larger sandbox. You can branch a copy of your code into a separate area and modify it in isolation (tracking changes separately). Later, you can merge your work back into the common area.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the entire concept and from the next topic onwards you will learn specifically about the Git version control system and also get introduced to GitHub."

    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Git and why use it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous topic you understood the need for a Version Control System. Well Git is exactly a kind of Version Control System (Distributed VCS). It is also free and open source. **Essentially, its a system that allows you to record changes to files over time, thus, you can view specific versions of those files later on**. Over time, Git has become an industry standard for development. Being able to snapshot your code at a specific time is incredibly helpful as your codebase grows and you have to reference previous versions of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when you edit a text file, git can help you determine exactly what changed, who changed it, and why. Git isn't the only version control system out there, but it's by far the most popular. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difference between Git and other distributed version control systems**\n",
    "\n",
    "The major difference between Git and any other VCS (Subversion and friends included) is the way Git thinks about data. Conceptually, most other systems store information as a list of file-based changes. These other systems (CVS, Subversion, Perforce, Bazaar, and so on) think of the information they store as a set of files and the changes made to each file over time (this is commonly described as delta-based version control).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='../images/delta.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Git doesn’t think of or store its data this way. Instead, Git thinks of its data more like a series of snapshots of a miniature filesystem. With Git, every time you commit, or save the state of your project, Git basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. To be efficient, if files have not changed, Git doesn’t store the file again, just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored. Git thinks about its data more like a stream of snapshots.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='../images/git.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Git lingo**\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets understand some terminologies which are going to be important in order to properly understand the workflow of Git. They are described below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Snapshot**: It records all your files at a given point of time so that you can look up at them anytime later. It is basically a way how Git tracks your code history.\n",
    "- **Commit**: The act of creating a snapshot is called a commit.\n",
    "- **Repository**: The location or digital storage where all your files are stored.\n",
    "- **Head**: The reference to the most recent commit is called Head.\n",
    "- **Branches**: Git follows a sort of tree-like analogy for keeping track of code, when several people are collaborating on a project. The general procedure is to make a branch from the master branch, do the changes there and make a request to the master branch to merge the code. All commits live on some branch and there can be many branches in a single project repository. Refer the image below to get a visual understanding of branches. <img src='../images/branch.png'>"

    "Branching is probably one of the most dreaded topics for beginners trying to get a grasp of Git. Branches let us copy code into a separate folder so we can monkey with it separately. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a software project the main code is stored in the master branch (as the name suggests). Whenever a developer wants to make some changes in the main code base or add a new project module, he is expected to do these steps sequentially: \n",

    "- Make the changes/add new modules to that branch itself and test the code properly\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visual guide to branching**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src='../images/branching.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of the main trunk (blue horizontal bar) as the master branch. The version **r4** has the list of items *Milk, Eggs and Soup*. It also has a version **r7** ahead of it but you decide to revert to **r4** and tinker with some changes there. So what you do is:\n",

    "- To incorporate both *Juice* and *Milk* into the master branch, what needs to be done is submit  a **PULL** request\n",
    "- After Joe merges the files, Sue can do a regular “pull and update” to get the combined file from Joe. She doesn’t have to merge again on her own.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rise of conflicts**\n",
    "\n",
    "Git automaticallys merges changes to different parts of a file. But sometimes these changes are inconsistent and conflicts can arise when changes appear that don't gel. For example take the situation described by the image below:  Joe wants to remove eggs and replace it with cheese (-eggs, +cheese), and Sue wants to replace eggs with a hot dog (-eggs, +hot dog).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='../images/conflict.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point its a race: if Joe checks in first, that’s the change that goes through (and Sue can’t make her change). When changes overlap and contradict like this, Git might report a conflict and not let you proceed further. How to get out of it? Well two aproaches are given below:\n",
    "- **Re-apply your changes**: Sync to the the latest version (r4) and re-apply your changes to this file: Add hot dog to the list that already has cheese.\n",
    "- **Override their changes with yours**: Check out the latest version (r4), copy over your version, and check your version in. In effect, this removes cheese and replaces it with hot dog.\n",

    "\n",
    "Also, the master branch is deployable i.e. it is your production code, ready to roll out into the world. The master branch is meant to be stable, and it is the social contract of open source software to never, ever push anything to master that is not tested, or that breaks the build. The entire reason GitHub works is that it is always safe to work from the master.\n",

But since they are not recommended to do it in the master branch what every developer does is use branches created from master to experiment, make edits and additions and changes, before eventually rolling that branch back into the master once they have been approved and are known to work. Master then is updated to contain all the new stuff.\n",

Once on the master branch, all we have to do is run the merge command. The best way to do this is to type **`git merge BranchName –no-ff`** — the additional `–no-ff` tells git we want to retain all of the commit messages prior to the merge and `BranchName` is the experiment branch. This will make tracking changes easier in the future. Now if you do an **`ls`** command, observe how `poem.py` pops up! This means that we have successfully merged! \n",
