    "### 1.1 What is classification?\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification is a central topic in machine learning that has to do with teaching machines how to group together data by particular criteria. It is different from regression in the sense that target variables in classification are discrete in nature while in regression they are continuous. Remember that both regression and classification fall into the category of supervised learning approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an also an unsupervised version of classification, called clustering where computers find shared characteristics by which to group data when categories are not specified (we will encounter it later, not in this concept).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='../images/example.jpg' >\n",
    "\n",
    "Other common examples of classification come with classifying loan defaulters, predicting patients as having diabetes or not etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "All these types of classification problems can be effectively solved by Logistic Regression. Even though it contains the word \"regression\", do not take it as a regression algorithm. It is a linear model for classification and is widely used both in academia and industry mainly due to its simplicity and interpretibility. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the difference between linear regression and logistic regression?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Outcome*: This is the fundamental and possibly the most intuitive difference between both the algorithms. In linear regression, the outcome (dependent variable) is continuous. It can have any one of an infinite number of possible values, for instance, weight, height, number of hours, etc. Whereas in logistic regression, the outcome (dependent variable) has only a limited number of possible values. For instance, yes/no, true/false, red/green/blue, 1st/2nd/3rd/4th, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Linear regression output as probabilities*: Its tempting to use the linear regression output as probabilities but it's a mistake because the output can be negative, and greater than 1 whereas probability can not. As regression might actually produce probabilities that could be less than 0, or even bigger than 1, logistic regression was introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Equation*: Linear regression has its own equation of the form: $y = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1x_1 + ...+ \\theta_nx_n$. Logistic regression has a somewhat different equation as it interprets probability. You will learn more about it in the coming chapters where its equation is given by $ y = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\\theta_0 + \\theta_1x_1 + ...+ \\theta_nx_n)}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*NOTE*: **Although there is regression at the end of its name Logistic Regression is used for classification purposes. At the same time it is a form of linear model only since the logistic function is a linear combination of weights (you will see later on in this course).**"

    "So far we have discussed binary classification only. But what if we have more than two target classes? How to approach such problems? For this kind of situations we will be covering two methods; namely One-vs-All (One-vs-Rest) method and the Softmax method. Lets discuss them in details.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *__One-vs-all Method__*\n",
    "\n",
    "   Consider the situation where you have K classes ( $ K > 2 $ ). You will create classifiers equal to the number of classes and use each of them to predict one class as 1 and other classes as 0s. Then you combine all the classifiers and obtain a single new classifier which assigns probabilities to instances belonging to every class. On encountering a new instance, it will output probability of that instance belonging to every class and in general we select it as the highest of the predicted probabilities. But like all other methods, this approach is also not bullet-proof. Particularly in problems with class imbalance it doesn't have the desired effect.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   For example you have a situation at hand to classify shapes as triangles, squares and crosses. So for this classification problem you will make 3 logistic classifiers. The first classifier will classify triangles as 1s and the other classes as 0s. Similarly the second classifier will classify squares as 1s and other classes as 0s and the third one will classify crosses as 1s and other classes as 0s. We combine these three classifiers and obtain a single classifer which can now classify shapes into any of the three classes. \n",

It is  a non-convex function and chances are we might get stuck in some local minima while optimizing our solution. \n",
