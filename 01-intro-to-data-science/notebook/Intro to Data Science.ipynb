    "> Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. - Arthur Samuels (1959)\n",
    "\n",
    "First let us understand the difference between a traditional computer program and a machine learning program. We will understand the differences through an example. Suppose we are trying to program how to recognise a car from a set of images. A typical traditional program would help you identify a car through a set of rules. General rules for a car are \n",
    "- it has wheels\n",
    "- it has headlight.\n",
    "- it has steering wheel\n",
    "\n",
    "![car_rules](../images/cars_rules.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then for a computer program, you can make the algorithm, \n",
    "if it has wheels AND if it has headlight AND if it has steering wheel\n",
    "Think of all the rules you need to list down to make the computer program work. It would be really CUMBERSOME. Also the program might fail if the images are of a different orientation. \n",
    "\n",
    "![car_diff_angles](../images/car_diff.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, think of a scenario where you can just pass on the different images of car to a program, along with some data to help identify the car and then allow the program to figure out the rest of the rules by itself. This is a typical ML program - which given enough data will generalize and figure out the rest of the rules by itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "So the difference between a traditional computer program and ML program is as follows:-\n",
    "> **Traditional Algorithm** - clear set of instructions to which we give input and get a desired output. A rule-based approach.   \n",
    ">  **ML Algorithm** - give a set of data and let the algorithm figure out patterns and rules to apply for future inputs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Before the advent of ML as a formal field of application and study, rule-based approaches were used to simulate intelligence. The `intelligence` of the computer system which played chess and defeated a grandmaster - [Deep Blue](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/20-years-after-deep-blue-how-ai-has-advanced-since-conquering-chess/) was essentially improved by a set of rules defined by other grandmasters of chess and improved search algorithms. So, essentially an expert defined a set of rules which helped automate some tasks and reduce human intervention. Thus, another name for these rule-based systems is `expert systems`. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Expert systems` worked well because the data generated was very structured in nature and the scope was limited.  Thus, it was plausible to define rules by hand. As the size of data keeps increasing, the rules need to be modified constantly. With the advent of semi-structured and unstructured data, rule-based systems were no longer practical. It would be something like - fixing bugs as the code keeps getting bigger. The advantage of ML is that it gets better as the size of data keeps increasing. In summary, the advantage of ML over expert systems is that it is scalable and generalizes well on data. \n",

    "For the machines to be successful and provide right insights on data, a lot of work needs to be done by human on data to get it ready.
