    "### 1.1 Why Python for Data Science?\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. The name **Python** was inspired from the comedy series **Monty Python’s Flying Circus**. It is an **interpreted** language, not a **compiled** one. This statement means that the original program is translated into \"something else\". Another program, called \"the interpreter\", then examines \"something else\" and performs whatever actions are called for. Besides, Python is **dynamically typed** i.e. we don’t need to define variable data type ahead of time, Python automatically guesses the data type of the variable based on the type of value it contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Easy to learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is very beginner-friendly. The syntax (words and structure) is extremely simple to read and follow, most of which can be understood even if you do not know any programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Versatility\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. It supports object-oriented programming, structured programming, and functional programming patterns, among others. Python can handle every job from data mining to website construction to running embedded systems, all in one unified language.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Community support\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's broad and diverse base means that there are millions of users who are happy to offer advice or suggestions when you get stuck on something. Chances are, someone else has been stuck there first. Open-source communities are known for their open discussion policies. In fact, most of the queries can be solved with a simple *Google Search*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Awesome and free libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "The libraries form the backbone for the success of any programming language. At present more than 140,000 projects exist in the **Python Package Index (PyPI)**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data science has been an early beneficiary of these libraries. Libraries like **NumPy**, **Pandas**,  **Scikit-learn** are extremely popular and widely used by data scientists worldwide. You want to start doing Deep Learning? No problems. Python has libraries like **Tensorflow**, **Pytorch** and **Keras** to help you out.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the best way to learn a language is to use it, you will be doing exactly the same in this tutorial. Lets begin!"

    "### What are variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are used to store values in memory. We can store integers, decimals, characters, words or sentences in a variable. In order to assign value to a variable, use the **equal(=)** sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "For ex: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 1  \n",
    "y = 2.0\n",
    "name =  \"Paul\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "                                           \n",
    " Here, `1`, `2.0` and \"`Paul`\" are assigned to the variables x, y and name respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "**Data types in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has 5 standard data types\n",
    "- Numbers\n",
    "- String\n",
    "- List \n",
    "- Dictionary\n",
    "- Tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Boolean** : They are nothing but `True` (`1`) and `False` (`0`) statements. Their only sole purpose is to evaluate conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "For ex: Is $2 < 3$? Yes, so it will return a value `1`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Is 'abc' equal to 'abc' (written as `'abc' == 'abc'`? Yes, again.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to use the `print()` function**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `print()` function is used to display the result of the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax is:  `print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, \n",
    "- `objects` is/are the values to be displayed\n",
    "- `sep` is the separator used between the values (defaults into a space character)\n",
    "-  After all values are printed, `end` is printed (defaults into a new line)\n",
    "- `file` is the object where the values are printed (default value is `sys.stdout` i.e. screen)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For ex:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 1\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Output is:**\n",

    "```\n",

    "**Determining the type of object with `type()`**\n",

    "If you are confused regarding what class an object belongs to simply use the `type()` function. In the example above the types of the variables are `int`, `float` and `str` respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "For ex:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(type(x))\n",
    "```\n",
    "prints out `int`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Checking instance type with `isinstance()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `isinstance()` function checks if the **object** (first argument) is an instance or subclass of **classinfo** (second argument).\n",
    "\n",
    "Its syntax is: `isinstance(object, classinfo)`\n",
    "\n",
    "It returns `True` if the object is an instance or subclass of a class, or any element of the tuple\n",
    "`False` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "For ex: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "isinstance(x, int)\n",
    "```\n",
    " returns `True` while \n",
    " ```python\n",
