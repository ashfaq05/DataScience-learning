8/22/18,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"My mortgage is with BB & T Bank, recently I have been investigating ways to pay down my mortgage faster and I came across Biweekly Mortgage Calculator on BB & T 's website. It's a nice, easy to use calculator that you plug in your interest rate, mortgage amount, mortgage term, and payment type and it calculates your accelerated bi-weekly payment for you and shows you how much quicker you can pay down your loan. Ours figured out to pay off a 30 year mortgage in 26.4 years ... quite a savings! 
I called BB & T 's customer service number to inquire how I get set up on this payment plan. I was told they do not offer that type of payment plan, but I could send in my payments bi-weekly but it would not be applied until the full amount was received. ( the money would sit in a "" holding account '' until the full payment amount was collected ). I ended up calling back a few days later thinking the rep I was talking to didn't understand what I wanted to do or was not knowledgeable of this program. I got the SAME ANSWER! 
I then asked for the corporate BB & T office number where I could speak to someone that was knowledgeable of this product. After 3 days I received a phone call back from a corporate manager stating they do not offer this product, and they were "" checking into why this is on their website ''. She stated they do have a few customers that make bi-weekly payments, but they no longer offer this service. 
I don't understand how they can have this active link on their website under their Financial Planning Center tab to mislead customers when all they say is "" I'm sorry, I know you're upset about this '' Sounds like false advertising to me!

11/14/16,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,Credit decision / Underwriting,,"The entire lending experience with Citizens Bank was terrible. The lender kept pushing a XXXX ARM, which we had considered initially but decided to go with a 30yr fixed. When we received the closing disclosure, it was a XXXX ARM, we immediately requested that it be corrected to the 30yr fixed we decided upon but they kept delaying and saying it was changed but would n't send it to us. They waited until the next day and then tried to convince us to waive our rights so it would n't push the closing date due to the 3 day clock reset. This seemed very intentional, like it was something they often do, because they sent us an email instructing us to draft a letter : -- -- From the loan officer : I have outlined the basis of the letter in this email. Please elaborate on why you wanted the product changed and make sure to include your contact information at the bottom as they will need this. 
"" To Whom it may concern, This letter is to waive my right to review the new Closing Disclosure 3 business days prior to closing. I must close on the property at ( property address ) or I face financial hardship in the form of losing my Earnest Money Deposit and property falling through. I must close on this property on XXXX. There is substantial expense associated with my drive and move to ( property address ) and require this property so I may begin ( new job ) on time. 

In addition this letter is to address the change in rate and product. This was done at my request, I requested a 30 year fixed rate loan that increased my rate to ( % ) and increased my APR. I decided that the 30 Year Fixed was a safe option to avoid the market causing my ARM rate to increase. I felt as though the difference in payment monthly was worth the security of having a fixed rate and knowing the rate could not increase. I am fully aware that the rate and APR increased and am fully aware of the difference in monthly payment however I still wish to go with the 30 Year Fixed and need to close on XXXX. 

My contact information is below and should anyone have any questions please do not hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to closing my loan. '' Please make sure to physically sign and date this at the bottom and send back so we can close on time. Thanks -- -- We responded with this : "" We do n't feel comfortable moving forward by waving our rights to review a closing disclosure. We would like to receive the corrected closing disclosure for the 30yr fixed including the corrected deposit amount and we understand that this will reset the clock. We would really appreciate it if this could be done tonight since our closing date has already been pushed more than expected. "" They finally sent us the correct closing disclosure. 

On several occasions we asked about having to open a checking account and were told we would have the opportunity to later if we desired but there would be no discount for having an account. We decided we did n't need one, during closing we set up our mortgage payments to come directly out of our primary bank account with another institution. 

On XXXX XXXX we received an email stating a form was to be signed that was forgotten during closing. The form was dated XXXX XXXX and was an ACH for a direct debit of the mortgage payment from a bank account with Citizens Bank. We said we were not going to sign it, we had already set up payments from our bank and signed an ACH form, and this form was not "" forgotten '' at closing. The form had an account number on it, we asked how they could have an account number if we do n't even have a Citizens bank account ... .It turns out they opened checking, savings and credit line accounts in my husband 's name without our authorization, they even charged the credit line for the opening deposit into the checking account all without any authorization or signatures!

11/28/17,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"I have been trying to open a small XXXX business since XX/XX/XXXX and had worked with XXXX of Chase Bank in XXXX XXXX, WI for business funding. During our relations she promised me she was diligently going to see if she could get my business funding with Chase, I was asking for a XXXX loan. After waiting weeks for a return call regarding her promise, I never heard back from her to this day. Without funding from Chase, we were left with no choice to get a $ XXXX loan from XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, WI ( formerly known as Chase Bank! ) for 33 % interest and our 2 XXXX XXXX motorcycles as collateral.Our thoughts are to pay that loan in the shortest time possible once we are able to open our doors for revenue. This money now was not only the money we needed but it also has $ XXXX of our property tied to it.4 days before we were to secure the loan I opted to open my business checking account with XXXX at the 2nd Chase branch in XXXX XXXX , WI. We did not want to sign for that loan but we needed to, to complete my business plan purchase. The ACH deposit happened XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX explained I would be able to get a $ XXXXcashiers check as soon as the funds were showing in my account. I checked my account Friday morning and the loan deposit was successful. I did n't make it to the bank Friday, so I went to Chase Bank Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX before we headed to Illinois to purchase and move my XXXX. Chase did NOT have any hold on my business funds until XXXX decided to put a "" suspicious activity alert '' on my business checking account making those funds unavailable to me. She ALONE sabotaged my move that was very time sensitive and prescheduled. She vindictively made my funds unavailable to me out of spite, she apparently was upset because I chose a different Chase branch to open my small business checking account. The money that was deposited was an ACH deposit from XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, WI formerly known as Chase bank. The deposit was cleared and considered hard cash deposit when I went into her branch for a cashiers check for the deposit of my XXXX XXXX purchase. This was supposed to happen XX/XX/XXXX at  XXXX in Illinois to move the XXXX to XXXX, WI. The move needed to be done in a 2 day process as XXXX. pieces of equipment and the entire XXXX was being moved 2 hours away. She told me I could not get the {$5800.00} and could not explain why. I was wearing a distinctive bright blue XXXX jogging suit, not knowing when left the branch without my deposit, she put an "" suspicious activity alert '' on my account with my description and copy of DL! She said she was going to call customer service and that she would call me back as we headed to Illinois. Being a Saturday banks were only open until XXXX. She had n't called me back, so at XXXX on my way to Illinois to purchase my dream, I opted to stop at the XXXX XXXX , WI Chase bank to attempt to get the deposit I needed. I was greeted with EVERY teller 's eye contact and as I was waiting to see a teller, the branch manager says "" everything ok ma'am? '' I turned around and responded "" yes, I 'm fine '' and I pondered on his attentiveness as well ... Note : bright blue jogging suit. Still not knowing that XXXX placed a flag on me, I turned around to the branch manager and asked "" Maybe you can help me, I 'm having a problem getting a cashiers check from my business account ''. While sitting in his cubicle explaining the problem getting the deposit check he continued to gaze at his computer and interrogate me on my intentions of my money! At this point I was still unaware of the "" suspicious activity '' alert XXXX placed on my account making MY business money inaccessible! I opted to speaker phone the XXXX owner I was on my way to meet in IL and asked if we could just transfer the money into HIS Chase account. The XXXX XXXX, WI manager interrupted us and said "" well, wait, you need XXXX cash? '' On speaker phone, XXXX and I say fine, cash is king! The banker said "" ok i will get your cash ''. I preferred a check but I hung up with XXXX and said I would be back on my way with XXXX cash. I patiently waited 6-7 minutes, anxious to be on my way to meet XXXX, movers, equipment technicians, friends and buy my dream. The manager comes back with his little green bank bag, placed it on his desk and said "" yeah, this is n't going to happen today. You will have to go back to the XXXX XXXX branch that you opened your account at. '' I said "" WHAT! I am on my way to Illinois and it 's almost XXXX, I ca n't go back to XXXX XXXX! This is a Chase Bank right?! '' He again says "" yeah, all I can tell you is go back to the XXXX XXXX location '' I started balling and literally shaking asking "" Why?? I ca n't move the XXXX unless I have the deposit! '' Why would n't they even do the internal Chase transfer?!!! A second female banker comes over and says "" Ma'am we need you to stop crying we have other customers in here and we are going to ask you to leave or we will call the cops. ''!!!!!!!! I now feel like a criminal not on my way to be a business owner! I also have held a personal checking account with Chase for years. I was supposed to feel like a business owner, not a suspicious activity character!!!! I called XXXX as I continued to Illinois and asked if she put a hold on my account. She explained "" Well, because when a large ( XXXX?? ) Deposit is made on a business account and a request for a large ( XXXX?? ) Withdrawal is made it 's considered suspicious activity. '' REALLY!!! XXXX knew over the past 6 months that I was trying to open my business! How is that suspicious! Chase was showing the funds available but she decided to change that because I opted to open my account with a different branch. She opted to put her hands on my business money that was secured by our 2 XXXX XXXX motorcycles, blood money really! She costs me thousands in lost deposits, last minute rearranging movers and trucks, turned into a 5 day move that was scheduled 2, additional expenses, 2+ weeks lost revenue, delay in opening my doors, and interest charges on the personal credit cards I had to use to buy and move my business!!!!! That 's not to mention how degraded I was made feel at the XXXX XXXX branch and my sanity! She cost me at least $ XXXX and I am now struggling to get my business open! I also quit working to open my XXXX! This was not how I was supposed to start my business and I trusted my business account with Chase. XXXX made a very bad decision and sabotaged my business move plan. After filing a complaint with Chase Executive office, they told me there was nothing they were going to do and told me there was no hold on my money but could n't give me an answer as to why I could n't get my money at 2 Chase locations! If Chase condones her behavior then they are equally responsible for the damages she caused. I also explained to her that the flag was acknowledged by the customer service rep who referred me to the executive office and XXXX admitted she put the "" suspicious activity '' alert on my account! She again said Chase did not have any hold on my account. What is suspicious about wanting money from my business account that was clearly legitimate funds from a bank formerly know as Chase Bank!!! Without a remedy to her actions my business will likely not be able to open the doors. I had to absorb all my personal credit and funds through this mess and I am tapped and maxed out! To keep a business relationship with Chase I would ask they provide a XXXX credit line at a very low interest rate ora cash settlement requested within.

Not only does it have my XXXX delinquency in XXXX but it also has my account being opened in XXXX. On top of that, the last time I was delinquent on any account was in XXXX. The name of the company showing the collection is Asset Acceptance Corporation. I have requested them to validate the debt to no avail. I am sure they purchased and ancient collection item and put it on my credit report as if it were still within the XXXX. 
As I have stated, I have not been delinquent on any account since XXXX and did NOT open any accounts until XXXX. There should be no retail credit account on my credit report opened in XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, or XXXX.

I have requested validation of this debt numerous times and I ca n't seem to get them to explain to me how they claim how I went delinquent on an account in XXXX that was OPEN in XXXX. On top of that, I am 100 % sure I NEVER opened any type of retail credit account in the above mentioned years. 
I want Asset Acceptance Corp. to acknowledge that this account on my credit report is re-aged, has become a zombie debt, and needs to be removed immediately. I have no plans on seeking legal action against them at this time, I would just like this resolved.

And filed to have me removed from the foreclosure matter. At which time I was removed by the Judge and their own attorneys office. None of which is stated in the letter they filed as their final findings even though a letter from their own attorneys office was provided to them stating I was withdrawn from the foreclosure and I was not a party to it and had no liability. None of this is in their final letter. 


Furthermore my credit report shows that they are showing that I am still late on a mortgage that no longer exists which is ruining my credit further. How can you say a person is 120 days late on a mortgage that was foreclosed on 2 years ago? You are ruining my credit. 

I was not a party to the foreclosure therefore the word "" foreclosure '' should not be on my credit report and furthermore you should stop marking me late on a mortgage that no longer exists.

On XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America withdrew {$4900.00} from my PERSONAL JOINT CHECKING account number : XXXX. This Personal joint checking account is in the name of me : XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX.

We called bank of America on XX/XX/XXXX and we were told that the {$4900.00} withdrawal from my PERSONAL JOINT CHECKING ACCOUNT was to setoff debt on a Company Credit Card belonging to XXXX XXXX XXXX, dba XXXX XXXX XXXX a Corporation, that had a business credit card. I, explained to Bank of America, XXXX XXXX that the Company was filed for Bankruptcy in XX/XX/XXXX and Terminated on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX argued that Termination is not Dismissal. I explained that in bankruptcy law, "" termination '' is synonymous with "" dismissal. '' The termination of a case means the court closes it and sends out notices to everyone involved, and no longer will consider motions or other litigation on the part of debtor or creditors. They said they will get back with me and asked us to send the Court Documents with regard to the Bankruptcy. We fax all the documents to them.

VIOLATION : The Federal Bankruptcy Law ( 18 U.S.C. 362 ( a ) ( 6 ) ; In re XXXX, 382 B.R. 892, 899 ( Bankr. W.D.Pa. 2008 ) and Violation of Discharge Injunction, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( In re XXXX ), No. XXXX ( M.D. Ala. XX/XX/XXXX.

FACT : There were two account numbers for that business credit card. One for the statement and the other was on the credit card as follows : Statement Account No : XXXX Credit Account No : XXXX ( Both are for the same Credit Card ) This business credit card account was opened on XX/XX/XXXX, and the last payment was made in XX/XX/XXXX.

VIOLATION : Section 337 of California 's Code of Civil Procedure which establishes a four-year statute of limitations for most written contracts. Last Payment paid in XX/XX/XXXX.

FACT : Bank of America has withdrawn {$4900.00} from our Personal Checking Account to Setoff a Credit Card balance which belonged to a Bankrupt Corporation, Saeed Investments , Inc., dba Growth Management Company.

VIOLATION : Truth in Lending Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1666h ; Regulation Z of the Truth in Lending Act, 12 C.F.R. 226.12 ( d ) ) and Section 169 [ 1026.12 ( d ) -Regulation Z ], prohibits a bank from exercising its right of Setoff by taking a credit card holders deposit balances and offsetting them against the credit card holders indebtedness.

FACT : On XX/XX/XXXX, we received a call from XXXX XXXX XXXX ( direct telephone number is XXXX ) from Bank of America and she said that this matter was escalated to her department and if an attorney would write a letter and confirm the XXXX XXXX XXXX  bankruptcy, they will redeposit the money back to my personal checking account. Our attorney sent them a letter on XX/XX/XXXX, and gave them until XX/XX/XXXX, to respond in conjunction with the proof of Bankruptcy. Since XX/XX/XXXX, our attorney also left two telephone messages for XXXX XXXX. As of today 's date of XX/XX/XXXX, they have not responded to our attorney.

FACT : In Joint Account the bank can not Setoff a debt due from one person against the joint account. Also, the bank can not transfer money from the credit balance of a particular joint account in satisfaction of the debit balance of an individual account of one of the holders of the joint account.

VIOLATION : ( a ) In XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Limited, XXXX  ( 54 ) L.T. 746., the following observation has been made : XXXX XXXX a separate debt can not be setoff against joint debt either at law, in equity or under the mutual credit clauses of the Bankruptcy Act. There is no authority for the bankers having a general lien in such a case as the present. '' ( b ) In XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Ltd. v. XXXX XXXX, the bank had issued a fixed deposit receipt in favor of A and his wife B payable to either or survivor. When a suit was filed by B against the bank for the recovery of the deposit, the bank refused to give the money and asserted the lien on the money on the ground that A was severally indebted to the bank. This defense failed and the Court held that the bank could not appropriate the amount of the fixed deposit against the debt severally due from A either in law or in equity.

FACT : I am XXXX years old and a Social Security Recipient. My Social Security Checks are direct deposit to Chase bank and I transfer money to this joint account ( XXXX ). The money that Bank of America Setoff from our Joint Account was part of my Social Security income.

VIOLATION : Section 207 of the Social Security Act ( 42 USC 407 ) IN CONCLUSION : Bank of America committed all of the above violation of the laws. Despite of numerous attempt by us and provide them with all the necessary documents, they refuse to reimburse us our money. Bank of America is among the highest in the nation for the violation of the laws and regardless of how much fines they continuously paying, they refuse to behave in an honest manner. On XX/XX/XXXX CFPB issued a publication to the banks with the title of Institutions on Preventing Elder Financial Abuse and advise financial industries to prevent elderly abuse. Unfortunately Bank of America is the real predator and abuser.

I respectfully request and need your help to get my money back from Bank of America. Thank you for your time and consideration.

On Friday XX/XX/XXXX I called Barclays and reported the fraudulent charge and my credit card was cancelled and I was sent a new credit card. This was a pleasant phone call. On Tuesday XX/XX/2018 at XXXX XXXX I received a phone call on a recorded line from a fraud investigator from Barclays. I believe that I offended him when I asked him some questions to verify who he was because he started asking personal questions. The person was rude and accusatory. Though I repeatedly on the recorded line told him that I had nothing to do with the fraudulent charge he said he could not accept the charge as fraud. The conversation became unpleasant and I ended it. I called back a few minutes later and spoke with another fraud representative and that person reviewed the recorded conversation and came back on the line and apologized and said that she did believe the charge was fraud and stated that my account would be noted. On Monday XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Barclays dated XX/XX/2018 stating that the {$160.00} charge by XXXX was valid. I called Barclays again and unfortunately I was connected with another rude and accusatory fraud investigator. He many times did not let me finish my sentence. He eventually read the notes and listed to both conversations from my previous calls and removed the fraudulent charge. In addition to being rude and accusatory he was condescending. The fraud "" investigators '' are poorly trained and not very good at their job if they though that this {$160.00} charge from a company based on another continent was a valid charge. I had no prior history of disputing charges. If there is a profile for consumers fraudulently claiming charges are valid I assure you that I do not fit this profile.

7/11/17,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"In XX/XX/XXXX, I fell behind in my mortgage payment since my income with my new employer was less than my previous employer. I had been a political appointee and with the change of the Governor and his new admin., I decided to use the guidance of an outside firm to assist me with getting a loan modification with my present lender, Wells Fargo Home Mortgage Company . I felt that I needed to have an outside firm assist me with communicating with Wells Fargo to submit the required documentation for a loan modification because in XX/XX/XXXX I called Wells Fargo Hm. Mortgage Co. several times and they were not consumer friendly at all. In fact the representatives that I spoke to were abrupt and made it difficult for me to receive the information that I needed to apply for a loan modification. The representatives from Wells Fargo were intimidating and did not respond to my questions and I was dismissed in my efforts to gather the information for their process. On a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 representing being helpful, Wells Fargo was a minus 10. The company that was assisting me was named XXXX XXXX. XXXX assisted me with gathering the financial documents that I would need for consideration and they communicated directly with Wells Fargo on my behalf and my package was submitted by XXXX XXXX to Wells Fargo in XX/XX/XXXX. My ex Fiance had moved out of the home in XX/XX/XXXX and moved to another State and purchased another home. In XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo contacted XXXX and requested a quit claim deed be signed by my ex partner and recorded in court. I made an effort to take this signed quit claim deed to the court house as instructed and the XXXX XXXX XXXX County courthouse indicated that property taxes had to be paid and the cost was about {$5500.00}. and some change. I did not have {$5500.00}. to pay the court to get the quit claim deed recorded and i explained that if I had {$5500.00}. that I would have paid that towards the arrearage to bring my loan current. My home preservation specialist at that time that was assigned to me by Wells Fargo was XXXX XXXX. Wells Fargo closed my file and refused to review my documents that were submitted because they said that their policy was that the quit claim deed HAD TO BE RECORDED. So I was denied at that point and I contacted XXXX XXXX to make the request for Wells Fargo to make an exception. I had tried to go to the court house and had received a copy of the invoice from the court and also sent a copy as proof that I had been there as the invoice was stamped with the date and time. XXXX 's response to me was that he would have to speak to the investor of the loan which was XXXX. XXXX XXXX to determine if they would agree to review my file. At this point, I was assigned a home preservation specialist in the Office of the President named XXXX XXXX. When I had my first conversation with XXXX XXXX he was very rude, combative and unbending. He also raised his voice during my very first conversation with him. I was also introduced to the Office Manager named XXXX XXXX who was very professional. I told XXXX XXXX how unprofessional XXXX XXXX was and how verbally abusive he was especially to be working and representing the Office of the President with Wells Fargo. XXXX XXXX offered to reassign another XXXX however, the process had been dragging on and I felt that it would postpone and delay a response from Wells Fargo even in as much I wanted to have a rep. that genuinely cared about the customer and XXXX XXXX spoke with negative language such as short sale and foreclosure rather than try to look for a positive solution. During my conversation with XXXX XXXX, he went on to say to the rep. at XXXX ( in a separate conversation ) who also felt that XXXX XXXX was very combative, that I was behind in my property taxes that are by the way escrowed and paid by Wells Fargo which is why the {$5500.00}. was due. This was far from the truth. In fact, XXXX XXXX and I spoke and she stated that she researched it with the taxed dept. and it was concluded that the burden of responsibility was on Wells Fargo and that they had to pay the $ XXXX.in order to get the quit claim deed recorded. XXXX XXXX stated that I was absolutely correct in stating that I was not behind in my property taxes like XXXX XXXX had raised his voice and said and that Wells Fargo 's position was that they would have to make a special request to XXXX XXXX XXXX County court to send them an invoice earlier than normal and that was what they were moving towards. XXXX XXXX did state that she was not a home preservation specialist but she was trying to assist me. Another week passed and suddenly Wells Fargo decided to move forward with reviewing my file and made a decision to reopen my file for a decision. Something in the back of my mind told me not to trust Wells Fargo because after several weeks of demanding a quit claim deed that had to be recorded before they would even consider reviewing my file, XXXX XXXX stated that Wells Fargo decided that they did not even need the quit claim deed and now they were going to make a decision without a recorded deed. When Wells Fargo thought it was my responsibility to pay the {$5500.00}. and get a recorded deed, they were very demanding and to the point of being down right rude about their position as this was their policy! So now since the burden was on them, their decision was to completely forget about the quit claim deed and XXXX did not even try to pay it but threw the idea to the curb as now it was no longer their policy in order to review my file after giving me XXXX for this so called policy since XX/XX/XXXX and now it is XX/XX/XXXX. and I have been waiting for a response from them for weeks. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX sent me an email stating that Wells Fargo made a decision in hopes that I would call him. XXXX XXXX did not even have the decency to pick up the phone to discuss the matter nor was he helpful with alternative options. I am convinced that XXXX XXXX was born without a heart and lacks the manners of someone who said his desk was in the Office of The President. He should work in a mail room sorting mail as long as he does n't have to communicate with people or be heard. XXXX XXXX stated that he wanted to help me. He followed that statement with I could do a short sale, bring my mortgage up to date and at that point I told XXXX XXXX that I was getting off of the phone because he seemed to gloat in wanting to see my home go into foreclosure. XXXX XXXX just stated that my case was denied due to lack of income. Wells Fargo could have granted a loan modification but I assume with all of the hefty fines, they want to continue to be as deceptive as they always have been. Understanding all of the complaints of fraud committed towards consumers by Wells Fargo over the years, it would seem that Wells Fargo would be motivated to coming up with alternative options and solutions to help their customers instead of using threatening tomes and verbiage with their customers and mainly to adhere to policies of the processes for their programs instead of making policies up as they go along. Their policies are situational. I intend to bring my past dues up to date and attempted to speak to a representative in the Office of the President named XXXX XXXX to have her note that in my file. XXXX XXXX responded to me that she could not note my file because I was calling from work and I did not have my mortgage account number with me at the time and that she COULD NOT locate my file without the account number even though I said I could provide my social security number and complete address. And yet this woman also worked in the Office of the President as Wells Fargo!!! This is unheard of to receive this kind of disparate treatment. I am convinced that Wells Fargo discriminates against single women, especially XXXX XXXX women. So I will have to call again today on XX/XX/XXXX to make an effort to get my intent to pay my past due amount documented in my file. XXXX XXXX did not even care or lift a finger to assist me. She said she could not do it..",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,MD,207XX,,Consent provided,Web,7/11/17,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2570475

12/29/15,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Can't repay my loan,Can't decrease my monthly payments,"XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, MA XXXX XXXX XXXX, 2015 Honorable Senator : I am in need of your assistance. The situation is thus, a few years ago I cosigned student loans for my Daughter XXXX. Situations that were unforeseen occurred. My Daughter XXXX reneged on repaying the student loans. XXXX of the loans went to collections, when I was contacted by the collection agency I was threatened. Not knowing any better, I started to make payments. I later found out that what they did was illegal. 

I am getting on in years and ready to retire. Things have gotten worse. I had to file for bankruptcy to protect my home. Tried to take advantage of the HARP program, but was denied due to no credit. It 's to the point, We are living paycheck too paycheck. 
We have no funds available to cover any unforeseen problems that may come. 

The funds should 've gone directly to the college instead they went to the student. In our case, she spent all the money on herself and not for further education. The funds should go directly to the college. Out Daughter XXXX, scammed us and the loan originators. 

We are at the point that we can no longer afford to repay these student loans. I believe your office can help us. Why is it that the student is not responsible for repaying the loans, the loan companies go after the cosigner? 

I believe you could submit legislation to prevent this from ever happening to anyone again. The student should be held accountable and be responsible for repaying their student loans and not the cosigner. 

But in the meantime, I need any assistance Your Office can provide Me. Any help you can offer would be greatly appreciated, in regards to programs or legal legislation that can offer student loan forgiveness.

7/7/18,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"Over the last few years, especially since Navient took over, I have had repeated issues with my private, and recently federal, loans from XXXX  school ( XXXX ). My private loans have been in repayment for years, and at least once a year, Navient redirects the funds to other loans. Even when my federal loan was in economic hardship forbearance ( meaning not in repayment ), they directed private loan monies to the federal loan. Then they harassingly call me ( and my elderly father as co-signer ) to say I'm delinquent when it is their mistake is misappropriating my payment. It is SO FRUSTRATING!! It just happened again. Now that my federal loan is in repayment they misappropriated those monies as well. I am never told the same thing twice by any representatives. I brought my federal loan current in XX/XX/XXXX and then started its repayment, only to be told yesterday ( XX/XX/XXXX ) that the representative gave my the wrong amount to bring it current and that I have been charged late fees since XX/XX/XXXX on an amount I never knew was outstanding. It just can't be right. The private and federal departments are separate and seem unable to speak to one another when these issues arise making it almost impossible to resolve these errors. I was on the phone yesterday for 2 hours and 11 minutes - only to learn that, again, they had moved the money to the wrong account. I can not help but wonder if there is something illegal going on ...? They also keep suggesting that I directly deposit to them to make things easier ; or make my payments through their website. Like I would ever let them be in charge of my money. They do not know what they are doing. It really is criminal. In fact, yesterday, when I forced them to go over the details of my accounts and payment history, they informed me that one on my private loans was paid. They never let me know and payments kept electronically going to that account. They said they were just applying them to another loan group. How is this possible?? I keep threatening to get a lawyer every time I speak to them. It really is unconscionable the way they handle this business. I was also told yesterday ( XX/XX/XXXX) that when I over pay my loan amounts it makes it "" harder for them to know where the money should go ''. Seriously? Isn't that what account numbers are for? Everyone knows that one of the first things you do as a student borrower is to over pay as able to decrease the amount of time you are in repayment. To me, it seems that Navient 's representatives are suggesting that I keep my payments lower to increase the amount of interest I accrue and therefore have to pay them. Bad advice - and maybe illegal to suggest ...? I am a medical professional and have run a successful practice for the last ten years. I can not believe how demeaning it is to deal with Navient. It just has to stop. For me, yesterday was the last straw. I have these loans because I have a profession that I love and spend my life helping others. I can not believe that I am forced to constantly deal with this mistreatment and mishandling of my money. If there is any way someone can assist me, I would be very grateful.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",NY,100XX,,Consent provided,Web,7/7/18,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,2956872

I was told by ERC to not dispute the entry, and that they would correct the false entry and it would take up to 45 days for the information to be updated.

The order also restricts situations in which the company can leave voicemails that disclose the alleged debtor 's name and the fact that he or she may owe a debt.

I applied and made several calls to them to have my cosigner name released and every time request has been denied. My cosigner has no income. 
Every time, I call or request, the requirements to release the cosigner changes. 
This loan was approved with help of cosigner, which was recommended by XXXX Bank to increase the chances of my approval at the time of an application. Now, it has been more than 4 years, I have been making timely payments. I have checked all the loan disclosure papers, no where it says the requirements needed to release the cosigner. 
Please help me find, where on those loan papers we signed, says what are the requirements to release the cosigner at the time of approval of the loan. Why did the requirement to release the cosigner name went from 12 continuous monthly payments to 24, 36 and 48. Why is there a need to check credit reports for the borrower and cosigner ( has no income now ) all over again. Does XXXX XXXX bank wants to punish the borrower and cosigner?

8/6/18,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Funds not handled or disbursed as instructed,"On XX/XX/XXXX I deposited a check in the amount of XXXX dollars. I had a very difficult financial month and really needed this money. I deposited my check into my Bank of America account, which is the only bank I use and have used them since I started banking. Normally their policy is to approve and clear a portion of the funds ( usually half the check ) and then within 2 business days ( sometimes more depending on if its a weekend ) they will clear the rest of the funds. Not only did they not do this but they placed a hold on my account, the atm ate my card, and they said theyre withholding the check funds until XX/XX/XXXX. This was frustrating for two reasons. It went against their normal policy ( Ive deposited checks before and it never does this ), and they put my account on hold and took my debit card. Leaving me stranded all weekend with no way to buy food or make any necessary arrangements. I also drive for work so this prevented me working because I couldnt purchase gas. When I went in Monday, the banker assured me my check would clear by the next business day and assigned me a temporary debit card while a new one was being mailed to me. Tuesday comes and not even a portion of the check has cleared. Wednesday rolls around and nothing has cleared. And on top of that not clearing they have approved an automated payment for which I had insufficient funds to cover. This puts me into overdraft and charges me a fee. Finally Thursday comes and half the check has cleared. This put my account in good standing but of course I lost money on fees that werent returned to me. I took my car in to get repaired. They put a hold on my account that Friday because they said the transaction was too large for a temporary card ( despite the fact I had sufficient funds to cover such a transaction ). I go into the financial center the next day right as they open. I notice something strange when speaking to the banker. I notice it said I had over 800 dollars in my account but on my online banking app it said I had XXXX. I felt that was odd but I didnt press it at the time. I should have. But I deferred to what my online banking app said and used that as my reference point for purchases. The banker gave me a new temporary card and told me that the remaining half of my funds will be delivered on XX/XX/XXXX. Now at this time all transactions that went through that past week including clearing half of my check had all processed and cleared on my online banking app. I was even charged overdraft fees for the automated payment on Wednesday. None of that was returned and all transactions had cleared. Well much to my surprised early Monday morning I again had to cut Work short because I was unable to pay for gas. Why? I check my online banking app and its like revisionist history. Now my online banking app said that they initially cleared the entire check ( which as I mentioned earlier initially they cleared nothing ), and that later the following week I believe it was Thursday ( the day when my online banking app said half the check cleared ) that they declined the entire check and it was put on hold. It also said that all funds will be released XX/XX/XXXX. But they had already released half of my funds the previous Thursday so why theyre claiming that the check had been returned is still a mystery to me. They also claim that the previous Thursday ( the day after that automated charge threw me into overdraft and charged me a fee ) that they declined that transaction and returned those funds to me on Thursday maybe Friday but it was within 2 business days. However they never did this. None of this was reflected on my online banking app at the time. In fact I was checking it 2-3 times per day to try and prevent further overdrafts and according to my online app everything cleared. So now you can imagine my surprise as I now see my online banking app showing a completely different story. And now Im in overdraft again. Why? Because that initial automated payment has gone through again, but this time theyve also withheld the XXXX dollars from my check that they had originally cleared. This created insufficient funds and now Im in overdraft with fees again. I want them to reverse that charge and I want them to return the check to me so I can cash it someplace else.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",CA,900XX,,Consent provided,Web,8/6/18,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,2984280

I asked the individual why that had happened and he stated that USAA had found me guilty of being involved with the fraudulent activity that had occurred on my account in the past week. I was told that USAA was holding me liable for the negative balance in my savings account that had been used during the fraudulent activity. I proceeded to ask what would come of my direct deposit check that was going into my account the next day and was told they would hold it to pay off the negative balance. So I am now a fraud victim, that gave USAA 3 chances to try and fix the issue.

Regarding XXXX inquiries made in attempt to acquire a Citibank card. 
Regarding the inquiries : Application made on XXXX XXXX, XXXX was declined due to a recently established account -- I do NOT have a Citibank card. I received a letter declining the application stating that I had already had a Citibank card, I do NOT. The letter from the executive response unit also states this as a fact, it is incorrect and is a fact that can be proven. The inquiry needs to be deleted from my credit report as it was incorrectly processed by the Citibank system and therefore was not any possibility to be a valid and good faith inquiry based on the Citibank system, which is confirmed by the response given to the cfpb. The response goes on to state that a call was made by myself to the customer service dept regarding this account, again, which I do NOT have, and that after I called Citibank I never called back. There was NO REASON TO CALL BACK. Please review and provide a FULL TRANSCRIPT of the call which will completely explain what was discussed. Delete the inquiry. 
Regarding the application made on XXXX XXXX, XXXX -- -I was directed by the fraud department of Citibank ( as resulting from the above-mentioned call to customer service ) to make yet another inquiry, and to use a different address when making the third application for a Citibank card. I used my business address. In the response letter to cfpb it states that in this inquiry/application, my social security number could not be verified and a letter was sent to me with no response. 1 ) I never received a letter, 2 ) the social security number was clearly valid for the attempted applications made on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX, XXXX, so why was the 3rd application not validitated. 
I am again noting and was completely ignored and not addressed, that I have an identical twin brother with the same birthdate, same home address, and he has a consecutive social security number, which the customer service fraud department representative was made aware of and responded to in my call in to customer service regarding the SECOND application I attempted to make. There is NO FRAUD but there is a mix up in the application process of the Citibank system and this needs to be addressed and corrected. 
The response letter from the executive response unit nicely quotes legalities of the online terms and conditions for submitting online applications that Citibank is authorized to pull credit. Do they read what they write to the cfpb and the consumer? Does this make sense? Is this an actual response? Delete inquiries # XXXX and # XXXX from my credit report because there was no possibility of accurate consideration of these XXXX applications. I am certain this is happening to other consumers in their attempts as well, and this should be investigated if not resolvable.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",IL,600XX,,Consent provided,Web,7/11/16,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,2005631

I was told by Seterus there was nowhere to send my trial repayments while the loan was in transfer, and they were not sure whether they would honor the existing loan modification would be honored. <P/>I called repeatedly in the coming months, several times a week, sometimes daily to find out where to continue to send my payments as agreed. At first my records were n't available for what seemed like an inordinate amount of time. Then, once available, no one could find the loan modification paperwork in the transfer documents, nor knew whether the agreement would be honored by Seterus. They continued to advise me not to send in any payments. <P/>After several weeks, Seterus was still unable to find my loan modification paperwork so on XX/XX/XXXX, I faxed them a copy of the loan modification letter I received ( see attached ). Weeks after faxing it they said they must still be processing the document because they could not find it. ( I was told later they coded it under an incorrect title -- and every time I called could not find it. ) I continued to call daily but never received any definitive answer on what would happen with my loan or loan modification. While it was still in a foreclosure state, they would not accept any payments. I was in long-term limbo. <P/>After several unsuccessful months of frustrating phone calls, hours on the phone, and no results, I ultimately gave up making the calls. For the remainder of the year, I did not receive any communication from Seterus, aside from a monthly paper bill showing the total arrears ( which I could not resolve ) and under the direction NOT to send in the monthly mortgage payment. My hands were tied. <P/>Without warning, in XX/XX/XXXX I received a Foreclosure Sale Date of XX/XX/XXXX with less than 30 days to make good on the loan. I immediately called Seterus and was told the policy had been established that loan modifications in progress at the time of transfer would not be honored by Seterus. I would have to apply for a loan modification again, and there was no guarantee given the short window of time that it would be processed ( or approved ) before the Foreclosure Sale Date. However, they said if I could get everything in, they could possibly expedite it in 15 business days. <P/>I mobilized, prepared and uploaded all documents requested as quickly as possible, and uploaded them by XX/XX/XXXX. I confirmed receipt by phone, and was told electronic signatures were sufficient. I called daily to check on progress -- waiting again. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was told that electronic signatures were not sufficient ( even though I was told twice Seterus had everything they needed to advance the loan mod packet, including the electronic signatures ) so no processing had begun yet. They made no attempt to inform me of the new requirement for the wet signature, even though I asked them to phone, email, or use their proprietary email system to notify me immediately of anything else they needed. I resubmitted paperwork within 4 hours with wet signatures. <P/>I was also told that a new policy, effective immediately, required 37 days to process any loan mods. I requested that they consider expediting my application with the Foreclosure Sale Date so near, given my circumstances. <P/>On XX/XX/XXXX, I was told the package was reviewed in part by Loss Mitigation, but would take more time. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was told that the package was still in review. I requested it be expedited. I am still waiting to hear. <P/>I have been calling daily, at times twice daily, to find out if there any any updates on a new loan modification. I am hopeful Seterus will process my loan modification with a positive outcome, but time is running out. I am not sure what I will do if they do not push the Foreclosure Sale Date out, or decide at the last minute the loan modification will not be an option. I feel as though they should have been held accountable to honor my initial agreement with XXXX in the first place, and have since put a series of delays and roadblocks in place that continue to work against me. I would simply like to pay my mortgage and remain in my home of 23 years. <P/>I appreciate any help you can offer.",,"Seterus, Inc.",MA,,,Consent provided,Web,5/2/17,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2473598

Student loans from XXXX that I was trying to make good on through the XXXX, were transferred to service provider GC Services. They made XXXX successful attempts to contact me declaring themselves the owner of my loan ; thought they were picked up by XXXX with the rest of my loans ... I was wrong. 
XXXX address was garnered by GC Services via XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX no need to skip trace me ... still at same address ). The address was adopted to my credit report and thus adopted by my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX account and still learning more ... 
XXXX is a function of XXXX. The address was added to my XXXX credit report XXXX/XXXX/XXXX by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX collected from XXXX, a division of XXXX XXXX XXXX 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX gave the information to XXXX  They act like I am talking about area XXXX when I bring up XXXX. 
There was absolutely no reason to skip trace and/or change my address. This is systemic problem that occurs too frequently with full plausible deniability on the loan servicers ' part. They just send the bill to the wrong address and tell me it is my responsibility to keep my address up to date with the XXXX. It was until they changed it ... ..XXXX admitted to the practice of providing information that XXXX not be accurate and provides full disclaimer and disclosure that the information they provide is to be used at the risk of the user, that would be GC Services in this case. 

The scam is this : the student loan contracted by XXXX  makes a singular attempt to reach the owner of newly acquired loans XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. they barely satisfy the minimum requirement to inform the consumer of their new responsibility that is not a choice BTW. The default happens soo fast and they ca n't wait to sell you a rehabilitation plan that they get paid a commission upon successful completion. This serves as an economic engine of millions of students making 'rehab ' payments and tacking on fees and interest. All the while, the loan service ca n't wait to reset the clock if miss a penny. 
My first conversation with XXXX several years ago and XXXX XXXX yesterday was "" who are you? '' ... '' we own your loan, its in default, would you like a rehabilitation plan? "". The opportunity to pay the loan on time is often so obscure and this is on purpose. This is a very well ingrained scam where everyone but the consumer is getting a cut.

10/18/16,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"XX/XX/2016 we were contacted via mail from StateBridge that our Mortgage was bought by their company along with a payment coupon for XX/XX/XXXX. At the time of receipt we had no notification from the current lender at the time so we called them to confirm. So once confirmed we made the payment as per the statement. When we did not receive the statement for XXXX we immediately learned that this company is not easily accessible to its customers as hold times are extremely long, when you finally reach a person, they do not provide their full names nor do they give extensions. So with no monthly statements & lousy customer service we stated on more then one occasion that we are trying to establish a business relationship with a company that we have no knowledge of who they are. Statements are one way to do that & allows us the proper documentation we need to support our loan. We realized they are not compliant & of course we did not want to put our home in jeopardy so we made payments late but through our bank. Then we started to notice phone calls come in with no messages from the StateBridge # on our caller Id in fact one @ XXXX. Yet no messages or statement however oddly enough a couple of mailings offering mortgage assistance. So after months of no contact a phone call with a message from what sounded like a guy talking throw a microphone at a XXXX drive thru stating he needed to speak with my husband about an important matter. WOO HOO I can not wait to call him back to bad he did not leave an extension but lucky me I got XXXX XXXX on the phone, after I told her that I had not received any statements. She told me that it was because I filed for bankruptcy. I informed her that it was discharged years ago & my home was not part of the bankruptcy. She proceeded to inform me that if I know I owe a mortgage then regardless I should just pay it like I did to my previous lender. I explained that I had a relationship with that lender & I received statements monthly unlike STATEBRIDGE. Then I was told I in order for them to send me statements that I needed to give them permission because of the bankruptcy. So I said OK after I was verbal mistreated I told her my loan should be current except for XX/XX/XXXX as I just made my XX/XX/XXXX payment. I was then told that I owed them for XX/XX/XXXX, WHAT! I paid that to the previous lender, your problem not mine. Once again upset I told the rep I did but to the previous lender. So I was told I needed to call them & get my money back to pay them. Really no I have to do their job I am not employed but Statebridge. Somewhere she realized something & changed her tone & decided to email all my payments to review. I then call my previous lender who has great customer service & they explained what they told me & they reassured me that it was paid & it was part of the sale & they would send expedited correspondence to StateBridge to resolve the matter. So today a I come home to a phone message from StateBridge, so my husband calls & of course you can not reach the person that left the message so my husband talked to someone else. He verifies SS #, address, phone # my husband asked if the phone call was being monitored & if needed could he get a transcript. the representative verified receipt of the letter stating we wanted monthly statements but would not release updated account information to my husband. He then asked to be put on the phone with someone who could. Apparently no one was available with that authority. my husband asked him to verify that the account was up to date except for XX/XX/XXXX & he did. At the point my husband asked for a copy or a written transcript of the call & the representative hung up.",,Statebridge Company,PA,,,Consent provided,Web,10/18/16,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,2162970

The recorded message stated that there was a legal complaint against me and saying they were "" retained '' to serve me documents at home or work. The call instructed me to hit a number to speak with someone or call XXXX. I hit a key but the line hung up on me anyways. 

On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX I called the XXXX and spoke with XXXX XXXX. He told me that I have an unpaid Bank of America card from XXXX. After reviewing my info, he said the last four digits of the social security number was wrong. He said he would remove my number. 

On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX  I received another call from XXXX. I didn't have time to call back at that time and hitting a key still hung up on me. 

On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX, my almost XXXX year old mother, who is a XXXX patient, got the same recording I did saying I was going to be served with papers. She took a screen shot of the message, which the XXXX voicemail transcribed, and sent it to me with a text saying she thought I was going to be served with papers. 

On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX I called the XXXX number and asked for a manager. I was transferred to a XXXX XXXX ( pronounced XXXX ). She stated that she was head of the arbitration department. She told me that the social on the account was mine. She also said that my mom ( the XXXX patient ) would need to call in if she wanted her number removed. I told her the name of the employee I spoke with previously and asked her to review my ssn with him as he confirmed it was not mine. Throughout this entire call she continuously interrupted me to tell me that they weren't going to help, that it was my bill, and I need to handle it. I tried to tell her I asked for all the details to file fraud the previous day but she continued to speak over me and refused to assist, then hung up. Note : I swore an awful lot during this call. XXXX was very rude and telling me you're going to continue to call my mother when you know the bill is not mine is something that takes me right past angry into furious. Please listen to the call with employee XXXX XXXX ( previous day ) or with XXXX ( don't know her last name, on XX/XX/XXXX ). 

After XXXX hung up on me, I called every number I had for the company ( there is a LOT of phone numbers for them online ) but kept getting hung up on when I would ask for a mailing address for the company. Finally, more than a dozen calls later, I got XXXX. XXXX was lovely. She said their mailing address is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, MA XXXX. She says they have four locations. One in Georgia, one in Massachusetts, one in Texas and one in Indiana. She confirmed that around the time that XXXX hung up on me, my number and my mother 's number was removed and a note was put on the account that the social security number was wrong ( keep in mind that XXXX told me it was my social!!! ).

We would appreciate it if XXXX XXXX could provide us with information on the specific accounts in question. If he could please upload to his complaint a copy of a letter with a CCS file number and/or a copy of his credit report, we would be happy to investigate the consumers concerns further '' Please review attachment in this new complaint in which I am providing you with a credit report file in which your company placed a negative tradeline account onto my XXXX  credit report in XX/XX/XXXX. The original creditor is XXXX  for a alleged amount owed of XXXX.

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Ga XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Ma XXXX  Date : XX/XX/XXXXRe : Acct # To Whom It May Concern : I have previously sent you a request to validate my debt under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and all I received was an itemized list of the alleged charges you claim I owe you. This does not meet the Federal Trade Commissions guidelines of what constitutes proper debt validation In addition, in the case of XXXX XXXX XXXX ( IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF INDIANA, No. XXXX ), the court ruled that : 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) ( emphasis added ). On XX/XX/XXXX, nineteen days after the date of XXXX   debt collection letter, XXXX counsel XXXX  sent XXXX  a letter declaring that XXXX disputes your debt collection-related allegations, denies the same, and demands strict proof and verification thereof. Record at XXXX. As such, XXXX should have ceased his debt collection efforts immediately upon receiving that letter. Instead, XXXX proceeded to obtain a default judgment against XXXX  on the debt collection claim before he had mailed XXXX the necessary verification and, thus, violated 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ).

XXXX maintains, however, that there was no violation of the FDCPA because he sent adequate verification of the debt [ to XXXX ] in the XX/XX/XXXX notice of claim. Brief of Appellee at XXXX. Specifically, XXXX  claims that a copy of the consumer credit contract between XXXX and XXXX XXXX   attached to the notice of claim provided sufficient verification of the debt within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ). We can not agree.

The contract in no way provides sufficient verification of the debt. A review of the document reveals that it identifies only the terms of XXXX  loan, including a 17.99 % annual interest rate and the original loan amount of {$2500.00}. The loan agreement contains no accounting of any payments made by XXXX, the dates on which those payments were made, the interest which had accrued, or any late fees which had been assessed once XXXX   stopped making the required payments. Indeed, the existing unpaid contract balance at the time XXXX sent the debt collection notice was at least {$350.00} more than the original loan amount. Therefore, Brennan violated 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) when he failed to cease collection of the debt by obtaining a default judgment against XXXX  after XXXX  had notified XXXX in writing that he was disputing the debt but before XXXX had mailed verification of the debt to XXXX. We reverse the trial courts entry of summary judgment in favor of XXXX on this issue.

I notice that you are still reporting this collection on my credit report, which is considered to be a collection activity. You are now in violation of the FCPDA, and are now subject to fines of {$1000.00}, plus actual damages and attorneys fees, which I may collect from you by filing a claim in small claims court. These collections on my credit report are causing me severe problems in trying to purchase a home and the damage could lead into the $ 1000s.

You should also be aware that reporting such invalidated information to major credit bureaus might constitute defamation of character, as the negative marks on my credit report harm my credit and prevent me from enjoying all the benefits of good credit. In addition, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) does not allow the inaccurate reporting of information on my credit report and under this act. Therefore, if you do not immediately remove this account from my credit report, you are subject to another {$1000.00} fine, plus punitive damages.

US Bank refused to comply with dispute of the debt to the point of continued false statements to third persons made because most of them will permit them to and terminate the matter with whatever the bank claims. 

However, given the bank falsely reported all kinds of bizarre childish attention getting inflammatory fraud to third persons like XXXX, they kept claiming falsely to "" represent clients '', e tc, all about the same XXXX {$330.00} check that they bank in fact blocked payment of when I attempted to in order to make the harassment stop nearly 80+ days ago by now, of a stalking problem that is still here and making up more ways to conduct terror falsifying inflammatory claims to third persons including about my US mailing address recently that as per the attached US Mail was changed to my residential address for convenience that US Bank changed to an old address in XXXX XXXX that they claim it was never changed from falsely just like everything else they claim, flipping on their claims every time, until the bank clearly refuses to comply with the law requiring mandatory dispute rights for any debt claim the bank makes, which it is still retaliating for seeking via XXXX or CFPB. 

It then removed all public services nationally, first claiming it did n't do that, now claiming it did. 

Which continues to violate the law about dispute rights in claims of debt the law does not permit be paid instead to private individuals in cash only that like the rest of it is not likely to be credited to our accounts and as with this, would not make them go away that way either.

Because US Bank can not be made to stop my harassment at the outset when it refused to comply with the Cease and Desist or the dispute rights. 

It can not be forced to stop taking retaliatory actions making moot any remedy obtained by any method, which is a direct XXXX response to the debt collection laws that do not permit the damage infliction, the fraud, the harassment via third persons, and cutting off all public services nationally to harass by a company that makes fun of our asset and of the law and anything else. 

The damage infliction is several thousand dollars from the denied bombardments up to XXXX a day from people the bank claims never contacted me like they have falsely claimed to represent my clients.

10/4/16,Mortgage,Conventional adjustable mortgage (ARM),"Application, originator, mortgage broker",,"Bank of America processed a predatory loan modification on my arm loan in XXXX ( which was originated in XXXX ). 
In the modification they tack on {$27000.00} for late fees and back payment, and also 18 more years to the back end of the loan. 
No one ever spoke to me about the ramifications of what this modification was doing to the length of the original loan. Everything was done by fax. 
I was under does because my husband had died and I was on XXXX and I did n't want to be homeless. 

Then they SOLD my loan off to BURY what they had done. For future audit purposes. 

In XXXX, they SOLD my loan off to XXXX ( now XXXX ) who now informs me that it is over a 50 years on the loan. 

This was supposed to be a loan to help me not lose my home and not go homeless. What they did and processed is unethical and predatory business practice.

I have been getting collection calls at home and at work in addition to letters demanding that I make the payments even though I have sent the payments in. This is making me so nervous and scared that after over XXXX years of on-time payments, Wells Fargo may report me delinquent and ruin my credit due to their incompetence and errors. The reason they give for not applying the payments is because an erroneous escrow account is still open on my account and until the escrow account is satisfied, they will not apply my mortgage payments. This was the original complaint against them that has not been resolved as yet ( please refer to complaint # XXXX ). I do n't know what to do. I was instructed by Wells Fargo NOT to pay my XX/XX/XXXX taxes since e they erroneously paid them and are still working on the file as to why they paid the taxes again and why the escrow account was not removed after it balanced out to XXXX liability on my part.

As a result, my debit card was swiped across town at a gas station, an ATM, and then at an ATM that was associated with my bank. A fraudulent deposit was made into my account. I was totally unaware of the deposit, but reported all of my things stolen before I had any knowledge of the deposit. I reported my things stolen to the police. I communicated back with my bank to find out where my card had been swiped and how many times it was attempted. I reported my findings back to the police and requested that the ATM cameras be pulled so that I could press charges. This was an extremely long and drawn out process. They tried to have the cameras pull but the back hadn't fixed the ATM camera so it only caught the person 's chest and hand ( which clearly weren't mine ). As a result, the bank decided to close my account and reported me to XXXX  making it virtually impossible for me to get a bank account with anyone. I did my due diligence by keeping in contact with the bank, reporting what happen, and by involving the police.

2/22/18,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem caused by your funds being low,Overdrafts and overdraft fees,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I had to transfer {$5000.00} from my checking account to my savings account to avoid being defrauded by a fake airbnb user, while I attempted to fix the issue directly with Airbnb customer care. On XX/XX/XXXX, a purchase on coinbase went through on my checking account and the bank had to cover the XXXX purchase. I immediately received an e-mail notice of insufficient funds and after having resolved the issue with XXXX, I transferred {$4000.00} back to my checking account from my savings on the exact same day ( XX/XX/XXXX ). Apparently, the bank charged me {$70.00} worth of overdraft fees ( one for covering the XXXX on coinbase and the second one for my XXXX transfer to my savings account ) and withdrew it from my account without reflecting such withdrawal on my online banking transaction history. A week or two later, I received a Notice of Insufficient Funds on the mail, stating that the bank had charged me XXXX for my online transfer and for to coinbase purchase. After reviewing the notice, I checked my account again to see if those charges were reflected on my account. Not having seen the XXXX withdrawal ( or two separate {$35.00} withdrawals ) I thought the bank had made a mistake sending me that Notice and not charged me any overdraft fees since I covered the overdraft on the same day. Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX, the bank claims to have issued a refund for the XXXX, which again is not reflected on my online banking transaction history. After calling the bank 's online banking department and speaking to supervisor XXXX XXXX, the bank had no feasible explanation for what had occurred. The IT department of the bank figured it must have been because "" the transactions happened after the cycle had ended and I needed to wait for another cycle for it to reflect '' ( meaning the banking institution can just take out money from anyones account after the end of any cycle and it will not reflect ). XXXX XXXX encouraged me to speak to the Internal Complaint Department of the bank. After speaking to another employee, her explanation was that because "" the bank issued a refund, the transactions balanced out and the bank does not reflect that on the transaction history. '' Both answers given were false. I have screenshots of my mother 's account, who also banks at Wellsfargo, clearly reflecting when a fee is withdrawn and when a fee is refunded. This situation has been extremely alarming and concerning. As of today, those transactions have yet to reflect on my online banking transaction history. The notion that I have to trust that this is the first time this happens is simply preposterous. I can not believe a banking institution is allowed to withdraw money from my account and not reflect it. I went to a branch in my area and they kindly printed out a transaction history that is only available to them, which clearly shows that the XXXX were indeed withdrawn by the bank on XX/XX/XXXX and refunded XX/XX/XXXX.

I said I would pay the {$33.00} I owed but was told to pay {$70.00} I have taken a picture of of Macy 's own website on the date I paid my payment in XXXX it clearly shows that it was paid at XXXX on XXXX XXXX statement reflects that fact. Yet I was charged {$37.00} fee. I 'm not sure how the math works that I owe {$58.00} with a minimum payment of {$88.00} and then the following month I owe {$70.00} none of it makes sense.

Well they are not above law and soon they will be for a big surprised since I will never stop, never ever never stop. My property is and will permanent be XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX. I will guarantee that this case will be more publicized that XXXX collision and we will be in criminal courts too for the next 50 years. This filthy  law firm will not make money representing XXXX since they will be accused for covering up for them and will be on the same stand like this pirate mortgage service ng company. They will be directly involved if they continue to lie as they did so far. I will never be intimidated never. XXXX stole all my private property for which no Financial Institution was ever involved. I expect CFPB to force this Law Firm to reply  before a massive penalty will fallow. This Law Firm disrespect CFPB as well as many families. How many more criminal activity needs this Law Firm to do before we can close permanently their filthy activity of lying, deceiving, degrading people. Why we spend a lot of money fighting XXXX when we have them doing more criminal activity inside the country against American families. Why is so privilege such a filthy  company that abuse people? I filed 287 complaints against them and I will continue to write complains against them until I win my legal case. Next week I will go to the Supreme Court and I WILL NEVER EVER STOP until their filthy  lying lawyer will no longer have license to lie inside the courts. I will never stop NEVER until this filthy company is out of business and the layers involved in defrauding my property for which I do not have any mortgage will go to prison. As for the forge documents used by XXXX want to clarify the fact that the documents sent to foreclose on my property are forge document. Each document has an XXXX address and I sent this forge document to see from where this XXXX address came from so I can file criminal charges to that XXXX address user tooWhat is the difference between a mortgage and a Promissory Note? Homebuyers sometimes think of the mortgage ( or deed of trust ) as the contract they are signing with the bank to borrow money to purchase a house, but it is the promissory note that contains the promise to repay the amount borrowed. A mortgage note ( also known as a real estate lien note, borrower 's note ) is a promissory note secured by a specified mortgage loan. Mortgage notes are a written promise to repay a specified sum of money plus interest at a specified rate and length of time to fulfill the promise. The mortgage note states the amount of debt and the rate of interest, and obligates the borrower, who signs the note, personally responsible for repayment. Without a promissory note, a foreclosing plaintiff can not show a legal injury, i.e., does not have standing to sue. Without standing, the action before the court does not qualify as a "" case or controversy '' under Article III of the constitution. Courts can only make rulings on "" cases or controversies ; '' advisory opinions are a legal nullity. Consequently, a court that purports to enter a "" judgment '' where it has no subject matter jurisdiction has in fact entered a legal nullity on its docket ; that "" judgment '' is void as a matter of law. As such, any such "" judgment '' entered where the plaintiff had no standing is open to collateral attack in any subsequent proceeding. What is more, subject matter jurisdiction can not be waived ; were that the case, parties could falsely induce courts to make binding rulings -- obviously non-sensical. In essence, the ruling upheld that those who had purchased foreclosure properties that had been illegally foreclosed upon did not in fact have title to those properties. As mention many times soon I will get back my property and soon will start my criminal case against XXXX XXXX for defrauded my property and must pay {$260000.00} very fast CFPB specifically mention that all clients must get a response from any organization doing business in USA.

8/26/18,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"I have attempted to collect a fraudulent withdrawal from my USAA Mastercard account on XX/XX/XXXX, transaction number XXXX, in the amount of {$5000.00}, a cash advance fee of {$150.00}, plus cash advance interest in the amount of {$380.00} since XX/XX/XXXX.

During the last conversation I had with USAA regarding this matter, XXXX, a "" senior '' on the Executive Resolutions Team ( ERT ) relayed to me the fraud claim was by someone who had "" some '' ( unspecified ) access to the account.

USAA willfully and knowingly gave access to the above account after I called USAA on XX/XX/XXXX to secure the account from any other persons.

In preliminary findings and consultation with a lawyer inXX/XX/XXXX, it has become apparent USAA has engaged in similar practices with other USAA members.

Timeline On XX/XX/XXXX, I arrived home to XXXX, XXXX, after serving just shy of 18 months in XXXX. I was about to start out-processing the military for retirement and was on military leave.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called USAA to ensure all accounts were solely in my name, and that nobody else was authorized on any accounts.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I charged {$3.00} at "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CA, '' reference number XXXX on my USAA Mastercard.

On XX/XX/XXXX {$5000.00} was withdrawn from my USAA World Mastercard ending in XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX XXXX   KY, reference number XXXX. I was not in XXXX  XXXX, I was in XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, as evidenced by the two following transactions on the same statement as well as the XXXX XXXX credit card statement sent in to USAA XX/XX/XXXX.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I charged {$16.00} for "" XXXX-XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, '' reference number & XXXX on my USAA Mastercard.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called USAA to inquire about the cash advance and let them know I did not do it. The card was cancelled and reissued. I did not hear back from USAA. there are further notes below outlining my continued calls.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with USAA about the {$5000.00} that was taken off the card on XX/XX/XXXX. I called on XX/XX/XXXXto ensure no other authorized users were on the account, according to USAA. USAA stated I must write a letter to report it as fraud and may not be able to reverse the charges. USAA again cancelled the card and issued a new card now for this to go through.

On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with USAA and they stated that they still going through the dispute resolution process. I should get a letter within 60 days of the initial claim.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called USAA and was referred the fraud center where I talked to XXXX, ID number XXXX. I had talked to them several times earlier and he said he saw the notes on the file. Blake stated I needed to write a letter stating what happened, and send it to USAA Dispute Center, ATTN USAA Credit Card Services, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX   XXXX. I was to include his name, account number, the merchant number, date of transaction, and what happened in the letter. According to XXXX, I should receive a letter within five business days with a dispute number and the {$5000.00} should be removed from my account along with the fees and interest charges.

On XX/XX/XXXX I sent the letter to USAA about the dispute for the withdrawal of {$5000.00} in late 2014. I sent the letter return receipt.

On XX/XX/XXXX I received the confirmation for the fraud letter to USAA was delivered. USAA received it on 10 XX/XX/XXXX and it was signed by D Ortiz.

OnXX/XX/XXXX I called USAA at XXXX, talked to XXXX ID # XXXX, to check on status of the letter about the {$5000.00} taken off my card in XX/XX/XXXX. The letter was sent on 8 January 2018 and received by USAA on XX/XX/XXXX. There was no update to the claim and XXXX   reached out to a fraud investigator as to why it is taking so long but they provided no information. They are in contact with the third party bank. I asked why USAA has not sent me a letter stating they are investigating. She said that was a good question, the official letter has not been sent out, the account is still being updated. She stated she sees in the notes that I have tried on many occasions to have this handled. She can assure me that it will be sent out. Apparently since it is a fraud claim it is different than a dispute. The letter may be in the mail today and my account is supposed to be updated. As of right now, it is being investigated and they will reach out if they need any additional information.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called USAA and spoke with Antoinette in the credit card fraud department. She stated It is still in the process of being assigned to the fraud investigator. The claim was supposed to be assigned within 10 business days to an investigator and is now past the window. She also annotated the file to call me back regarding this claim in the next couple of days ; I let her know the best callback time is the late afternoon.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called USAA and talked to XXXX ( sp? ) regarding the claim. He stated I had called in the other day and put me on hold to look into the notes. He stated that not only is it a dispute, but it is also a fraud claim. He also stated that "" ... I have had business with them ... '' meaning XXXX XXXX in XXXX, XXXX, but I stated I had never had business with them. He said it would take up to 90 days to be resolved from the XX/XX/XXXX dispute date ( unknown reference date ) and since it is a dispute, no charges will be refunded until the 90 days have expired. I asked what had happened to the previous dispute that was again filed on XX/XX/XXXX for the same charge and he put me on hold again. He came back on the line and said it could take up to 60 days to get a temporary credit and the interest charges and withdrawal fees would be credited when fully proven. He stated the next investigation started on XX/XX/XXXX.

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX  from USAA called to go over the fraud claim and wanted some additional information. I answered all of her questions and let her know that since USAA records calls, there was plenty of evidence to look up. XXXX said she would call back the next week with more information regarding the claim. She never called back.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called to seek an update of the claim. On the first call, the lady ( unknown name ) put me on hold and I was disconnected. I called back and spoke with XXXX  in the USAA Credit Card Fraud Department. XXXX stated the original fraud claim was made on XX/XX/XXXX; however, since the fraud systems changed about a year ago, she was unable to look at thorough notes from previous to the system change. XXXX   stated this was most likely an in-person transaction. If it was through an ATM, they would have had to had a PIN number for the card ( I did not have a PIN for the card ) ; most likely they would have had to go into the bank. XXXX  also stated I would have to file a police report to get more info from USAA, but she referred me XXXX   in the Executive Resolutions Team ( ERT ). XXXX stated that I had done everything correct in reporting the fraud with the card.

XXXX  at the ERT came on the line and was curious as to why this claim was still not handled and stated she would do everything she could to get it resolved. XXXX stated she submitted an email to the manager of the fraud team to try to get a resolution. XXXX  said she would get back to me by Wednesday the XXXX. She asked if I could prove his location was and I said yes. I was in XXXX, XXXX, seeing my dying father and had a XXXX XXXX   that I had used to book the tickets. I sent the statement showing as much to her. XXXX asked if I had any further questions and to give her a call at extension XXXX.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a message into USAA using the Message Center about the great service I received from XXXX at the Credit Card Fraud Department.

On XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I called USAA and talked to Jamie about the fraud case. XXXX went over the times I had called into USAA regarding this case but said the dates were incomplete : - XX/XX/XXXX : presumably to check on the status of the claim.

- XX/XX/XXXX : "" protection restored '' - XX/XX/XXXX : said I hung up - XX/XX/XXXX : no notes - XX/XX/XXXX : looking for an update to the claim.

On XX/XX/XXXX I called USAA at about XX/XX/XXXX and talked to XX/XX/XXXX, a "" senior '' in the Executive Resolutions Team. XXXX  stated USAA determined the claim was a "" domestic dispute, '' stating another party had "" some '' access to my account ( unspecified ).

In XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted a lawyer about this case and they advised me USAA had acted illegally, I was not at fault, and I should be refunded the full withdrawal and all associated fees and interest. I was advised to send a final demand letter. I sent the letter on XX/XX/XXXXreturn receipt, it was received by USAA on XX/XX/XXXX by XXXX XXXX.

As of XX/XX/XXXX, I have not been refunded any monies, received an official letter the claim was ever made, nor contacted by USAA.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,UNITED SERVICES AUTOMOBILE ASSOCIATION,VA,221XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,8/26/18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3001976

My loan is in good standing and I make regular payments well above the minimum and have an auto-debit feature for increased payments. 
On XXXX XXXX, 2016 I entered XXXX. 
On XXXX XXXX, 2016, AES processed an automatic enrollment in a deferment without my knowledge and against my best interest since I was at least a XXXX student. 
I immediately protested on the very next day and asked for the deferment to be removed since I intended to make payments regardless of my status as a student as is my right. 
An agent of AES contacted me via email and claimed that it was in my best interest to have the loan in deferment, since the loan was subsidized and I would not pay interest. 
I responded immediately via email that the loan was not subsidized and a deferment was not in my best interest because not only would the interest accrue but I would lose the rate reductions in place on my automatic payments and the loan interest rate itself would rise because they charged more during deferment periods than payment periods. 
The agent claimed that was not true but they could process a removal of the deferment. 
I responded via email to reverse the deferment, it was not in my best interest. 
Another agent responded via email that I was in fact right, and they could reverse the deferment and put my loan status and payments back as they were, but they would not accept any more email communication and they would not correct the loan status until I write them another communication via post. 
The loan is small, the rate is small, and the interest charged in violation is small, so It would not be in my best interest to escalate to the point of damages, but these agents have fiduciary responsibilities to service accounts in the person 's best interest and can not change the considerations to the agreement to best fit their bottom line especially when a violation like this is immediately caught, protested, and a request to return to a payment status is made.",,AES/PHEAA,CO,809XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,10/25/16,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2177089

The loan was {$3200.00} and the payments were going to be about {$430.00} a month. I told the rep I could not afford the large payment amount and asked if they had a smaller loan. The rep said no but said they could give me a 50 % discount and said that someone would contact me to apply it. So I went ahead and processed the loan with that in mind. With a 50 % discount that would knock off a lot of interest and lower the payment. Well that's what I thought. Then no one ever contacted me to apply the discount, so I called the company about a week later and they said no, it's not a discount, it's a rebate after you pay the loan off. This was very misleading and I would not have signed up for the loan if I knew it was a rebate and not a discount because as I said to the rep I could not afford these high payments. The rep never said the words rebate. Rebate would have signified to me that I would get money back after the loan is paid off. But she said discount. Now the company is saying they can not give me the discount and I have to pay off the loan to get the rebate later. I was misled to apply for a loan that would offer a 50 % discount. This was faulty marketing to get me to sign up. The rep knew I could not afford the payment as is.

After the XXXX data breach, I had frozen both of our credit reports with all three major credit bureaus. On Friday, XX/XX/2018 I logged on to TransUnion for both my husband and myself and temporarily lifted the credit freezes until XX/XX/2018. Both he and I received receipts from TransUnion indicating the temporary lift was in place. On XX/XX/XXXX the bank called to say they could not get access to either of our credit reports. I logged onto both our accounts and saw that my husband had no active lift in place, but I did. I placed a lift on his account until XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX the bank called to say that they again could not access our credit reports. I called TransUnion on XX/XX/XXXX to find out what was happening. After several hours of fruitless navigation of their web site, I finally was able to talk to an actual person, who took information about my account, put me on hold to check the account, and then completely disappeared. I called again, waded through their convoluted phone tree, and finally talked to a person who was able to check our accounts. He indicated that there was an active lift in place for both accounts, and he had no explanation for why the bank could not access our credit reports, nor did he seem interested in helping us. The only advice he offered was that the bank should try again, and if not successful should contact their "" local marketing department. '' He was unable to explain who or what this organization was. I relayed this information to the bank and this morning XX/XX/XXXX the bank called to say with the help of the company they use to interact with TransUnion they were able to get my husband 's report but not mine. I logged onto my account yet again only to find that there was no active lift in place. I again put a lift in place for my credit freeze, and am waiting to see if the bank can access my report. Since these credit reporting agencies amass out personal financial information without permission and apparently any accountability to the consumer, they should at least be required to provide a minimum of customer service to make it easier for the consumer to control when access to this information is permitted.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",VT,,,Consent provided,Web,8/22/18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2998915

8/15/18,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"On XX/XX/2018, I received a response from CFBP complainant # XXXX. The response was a compromise from US Bank lowering the original quote of 1 % of the original loan amount to 0.25 % of the current loan amount as a fee/penalty for removing the escrow account and allowing us to pay our taxes and insurance ourselves ( see below attachment ). The response advised that we needed to send a written request to a specific entity with US Bank. We sent an email and a certified letter to the location that the specified. In this letter, we asked if the fee included clerical fees to amend the mortgage agreement that they purchased from XXXX XXXX in order to avoid paying the fee again should US Bank immediately turnaround and sell our mortgage. I received notice that US Bank received my email on XX/XX/2018 and I also received notice that US Bank received notice of our letter on XX/XX/2018. To date, I have sent additional emails with no response. I have called US Bank customer service as well as the number that they placed on the response to my last CFBP complainant. I have been transferred to voicemail and have left numerous voice messages. The automated message on the US Bank voice message advised that a return call would be placed within one business days. I can not get a response out of US Bank and at this point I feel as if they are refusing to reply. I know they have our contact information, as they are punctual on sending out monthly mortgage payment request. We are a month ahead on the mortgage and I have an excellent credit score. We are simply trying to eliminate our escrow account, as they are charging an additional XXXX dollars a month as a "" cushion '', then taking their sweet time to refund us the money at the beginning of the next year. We need this money for day to day expenses. Why should S Bank us my money for investment or gain interest on my money all under the guise that they hold the money as a cushion for set yearly Taxes and Insurance?

CFBP as successfully reduced US Banks willingness to charge me fee from 1 % to 0.25 %. Thank you. Could you please determine why US Bank is now refusing to respond to my request to remove the escrow account ( as brokered by one of their agents ). I have attached the last two correspondence, since the original CFBP complaint was filed.

8/16/18,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"On XX/XX/18 I hired XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX CA to build a professional, lead-generating, state of the art website for my business. The amount paid was {$3400.00} and the website was to be delivered by XX/XX/18. The merchant never delivered the product and became completely unresponsive to my many attempts to contact him for a resolution. 

On XX/XX/2018 I submitted a dispute with 15 pages of evidence showing the merchant was unresponsive and that he never delivered the product purchased. Citi issues an temporary credit and went ton investigate. A month later on XX/XX/18, Citi resolved the dispute in the merchants favor inexplicably. They provided the merchant 's response which had a one sentence paragraph stating "" Product built and delivered on XX/XX/18. In addition, the merchant provided Citi with a link for the supposed website they had built and delivered which consisted of a make-shift website that looked very similar to splash page crested on line for free. On top of the fact it was never delivered to me, the "" website '' did not have my domain name, and it failed to include my name, company 's name, contact information, address, "" about us '' section, basically it was missing all of the components of a business website. 

I immediately called Citi and asked them if they received proof of delivery from the merchant to which they answered "" no we didn't and we don't have to ''. I asked if they had reviewd the link provided by the merchant to where they said "" that's not our job ''. 

on XX/XX/18 I re-disputed the charge and this time I provided another 15 pages of supporting documents as well as a piece of indisputable evidence which I was sure would make Citi change their position. The evidence was as follows : The merchant stated the website had been built and delivered on XX/XX/18, yet the domain registration report for the creation of the website stated the domain name used and the website were registered on XX/XX/18. Meaning that, the website was created one month after it was supposedly delivered and conveniently after the merchant received the dispute. I made several attempts to contact the merchant which were all well documented and provided to Citi along with other supporting information, I provided the piece of evidence regarding the creation date of the website in question. I was feeling very good at this point, not only because I had provided evidence that the product was never delivered but also because I had proof that the merchant had lied in their response taking the level of fraud one step further. 

On XX/XX/18 Citi sent me aletter asking for additional information, except this time there was one specific request "" Proof of what was expected versus what was received. '' I couldn't believe it! I asked to myself "" are they messing with me? '' Regardless of how idiotic their response, I went ahead for the 3rd time and provided several pages explaining in detail that I had not received ANYTHING from the merchant. It was not a matter of the quality of the work or my satisfaction, it was a matter of blatant fraud and I had the proof which had been provided to Citi. Again, I felt pretty good about my bullet proof response. I received email confirmation that my response had been received by Citi. 

Today XX/XX/18 I received a correspondence from Citi stating the following "" We previously contacted you requesting information necessary to complete this inquiry. Since we have not received the proof showing the merchant was promise to deliver the merchandise, we are unable to assist you. '' As you can see it is so poorly written that I can't even make sense of what it states other than a big XXXX XXXX to me. 

This has been an ongoing matter which has cost me a lot of stress, time and effort and all because Citi refuses to even look at the evidence I provided. I also know that this merchant has done this same scam with several people and keeps getting away with it. Also online, I have found other 's who have been in very similar situations where the merchant fails to deliver the goods or provide any proof of delivery and Citi still rules on their favor.

There has to be something we can do? Somebody, somewhere has to protect us as consumers, and I am hoping in this case it is you that can help me. I know that maybe {$3400.00} isn't a lot of money to some people but for me and for my business ' current situation this is an amount that could put me out of business.

Attached is the latest package of information provided to Citi but needless to say I have a lot more which was provided to Citi during this process. I am more than happy to provide you with any additional information you may need.

I am very hopeful since I am at the point of desperation and have nowhere to turn.

2/5/17,Bank account or service,Other bank product/service,"Account opening, closing, or management",,"Good Afternoon. My wife and I have multiple accounts with Bank of America and Merrill Lynch including, checking, savings, credit cards, brokerage, and a retirement account. Bank of America and Merril offer a program called XXXX Rewards which works with different tiers. If the client has a {$20000.00} or more XXXX combined rolling average the client qualifies for the XXXX level of the preferred rewards. The XXXX tier provides the client with certain perks such as a XXXX % bonus when redeeming cash rewards to a checking account, a interest booster on your savings account, in addition to other things. About XXXX months ago ( or more ) my wife and I rolled over a retirement account into XXXX XXXX to ensure that we met the XXXX threshold. The rollover was done with a Merrill XXXX representative who was informed what we were doing and the fact that the only reason we were rolling the funds over was to qualify for the program. At the time I also gave myself a reminder so I would check in XXXX months later to make sure that we had in fact qualified for preferred rewards and were receiving the benefits. 

To date, I have called both Bank of America and XXXX Edge/Lynch about a dozen times and spent countless house on the phone, on hold, and waiting for a designated call back that never happens. Each time I call it is a complete hassle ( and a waste ) as I have to also get my wife on the phone so she can verify her accounts before being able to speak to a representative. Initially, we were told that it took a couple of weeks more than the XXXX period to qualify, so we decided to wait a couple of weeks, and when nothing happened called again. We were then told that the reason why the accounts were not showing as qualifying for preferred rewards was because we needed to change my wife 's maiden to her new married last name ( something we should have been told months ago but were not ), so we submitted all the paperwork to have her last name changed and the representative informed me she would call me back in XXXX days. XXXX weeks later she had yet to call. The next time we called I had to explain everything and a representative informed me that he would get a hold of the individual that was working on the problem and have her call me within XXXX hours, again no one called. About a week later I called again, explained everything and was told that a request had to be submitted to a certain department in order to have this issue corrected, I was told I would get a call back by the end of the day but never received XXXX. The last time I called XXXX XXXX I was told that a representative would call me back once the issue was resolved. Feeling absolutely sick and tired of being given the go around I informed the representative of my many grievances and told them if they did not actually call me back I would be closing our accounts as the only reason we had moved money to the bank XXXX moths ago was to qualify for the preferred rewards program, they never called back. Every time we have called we are told there is a problem and that someone will call us back once it is fixed, they never call back. Every representative insists that the issue must be resolved by either the last representative I spoke too or a XXXX that is never present, never have I had someone simply resolve the issue. I have been assured that I would receive a call back over XXXX at this point and every time I wait over a week and find myself having to start over from the start. We were told "" they would fix it, they would make sure that it was back-dated XXXX months for loss of time, and that there would be a follow-up call '' all false statements, and untrue. 

At this point, we are kindly asking if the CFPB can please step in on our behalf to advocate, as the bank is clearly unable to, or unwilling to handle the matter internally and we are absolutely hopeless.

I have been in a dispute with XXXX 's the billing and collection agency for XXXX XXXX Credit Card purchases since approximately XX/XX/XXXX. 

The charge dispute process and means of attempting to sustain charges is beyond words. I will attach as a PDF the last bill rendered. It shows a Bad of {$37.00}. As per instructions given in a letter I remitted {$16.00} for the shoes I purchased XX/XX/XXXX and there is a credit of {$20.00} representing the fees the letter advised XXXX would write off. I just hung up the phone question how there could be a NEW BALANCE of {$24.00} when there is {$0.00} Purchases ; {$0.00} other debits ; {$0.00} interest but a Fee charged of {$24.00}. 

I spoke eventually with a customer care representative who advised my gal is {$0.00}. She also agreed she would arrange to have the zero balance letter mentioned on the robot menu of choices. 

I will advise you if I do receive it but in view of recently reading this Bureau was set up as a result of the XXXX illegal practices I am following through with the complaint. 

Read their collections practices in the reverse. This is usurious and illegal. They continued to add more fees and interests to the disputed amount. They called me XXXX and 4 times a day with various Caller ID numbers but always from XXXX. Most times they hung up without a word. On two possible three occasions they advised me to call about my bill. It appears that XXXX is well known to this Bureau and what I had researched online indicated they are the billing and collection agency for several big name department stores e.g., XXXX XXXX. I eventually wrote to the Executive offices of XXXX XXXX recommending they end their affiliation with XXXX. XXXX XXXX answer was they could do nothing about the affect my dealings with XXXX had on my credit report and requested they advise XXXX to correct this also illegal practice when there is a dispute. XXXX XXXX response was basically to disavow any ability to deal with the credit rating, the billing issues other than to have reached an agreement I should pay {$16.00} and XXXX would wipe off the fees. 

If you like XXXX can do nothing advise me who can and will end these practices upsetting old ladies such as me.

The amount on the card was {$3000.00}. I paid the balance on the card prior to XX/XX/XXXX and never requested or received a replacement card, so I assumed the account was closed. 
XXXX XXXX, who was my wife at the time, was not an authorized user of the card, however, in XX/XX/XXXX she advised me that she had been using the card for some time. I don't know exactly how long, and she had accumulated a debt of over {$17000.00} on the card. She advised that a collection agency was trying to collect payment for the debt for Barclays Bank Delaware, and they had threatened to garnishee her wages if she did not pay a certain amount by a date certain. She also advised me that she was issued a card in her name on my account by Barclays. 
About a week before XXXX contacted me about this, I had received a letter from Barclays in which they claimed I owed them {$17000.00}. When I learned about the debt from my ex-wife, I wrote to Barclays advising them that I had not authorized XXXX to use my account and I did not assume any responsibility for the debt, and I requested them to remove the debt from my credit report. On XX/XX/XXXX Barclays responded to me that since their records reflected XXXX as an authorized user on the account, they considered the debt to me as accurate and they would not remove it from my credit report. I discovered from the credit bureau that Barclays had written the debt off in XX/XX/XXXX, although they had never mentioned any debt to me prior to XX/XX/XXXX. Since my ex-wife was never authorized by me to use the card, and Barclays never attempted to verify by me that she was authorized to used the card, I think they are attempting to extort money from me to pay a debt I did not incur or authorize, and I would like for them to remove the debt from my credit report and to not harass me about the debt again. My ex-wife did not reveal the debt in the divorce decree, because she intended to hide it from me. Therefore, because of her concealing the debt from me and the fact that I never authorized her to use the card and Barclays never attempted to verify that she was an authorized user and never notified me that charges were being made by XXXX on my account, I consider the debt her sole responsibility",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE,TX,775XX,"Older American, Servicemember",Consent provided,Web,8/21/18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2997983

I need XXXX to provide an explanation as to why they put this back on my credit profile. I never opened an account with XXXX. Under The Fair Credit Reporting Act, once an item has been removed it can not be re added. XXXX XXXX could never provide me with any documentation proving I agreed to this ridiculous debt. Even after I disputed with the CFPB, they still could not validate and agreed to remove and I have the letter so now why is it being added with different information.

I called a couple of weeks later when I realized they cashed my check asking when I would get a letter that the account was settled. They informed me that the account would not be settled since I did not called them prior to sending in the payment. There is nothing in the settlement offer that states I must call them prior to sending in the requested payment which I told them but they insisted that I was to call them prior. 

I asked to speak to a supervisor as I could not understand the person whom I was speaking with and she refused my request but told to "" call back tomorrow ''. I waited about a week to try to settle this matter again. And again I was told the account would not be settled as I didn't call prior to sending in the payment and also the payment was not received in the requested timeframe and that the offer was "" null and void ''.

As per the FDCPA, I have the right to request a validation of this debt. I request you to prove that I am indeed the party who is by contract obligated to pay off this debt. I hope you are aware of the fact that reporting any invalidated information to major credit bureaus may constitute defamation of character, as negative listing on credit report does not allow me to enjoy the benefits of good credit. In addition, you must also be aware that until you validate this debt, you can neither continue collection activities nor report this information on my credit report. I'm sure your legal staff will agree that non-compliance with this request is likely to put your company in serious legal trouble with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and other state/federal agencies. Please attach copies of the following documents : 1 ) Agreement with your client that authorizes you to collect on this alleged debt. 2 ) Agreement that bears signature of the alleged debtor wherein he promises to pay the creditor. 3 ) Complete payment history on this account so as to prove that the debt amount you wish to collect is correct.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Waypoint Resource Group, LLC",FL,33687,,Consent provided,Web,8/20/18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2996984

2/4/16,Credit reporting,,Credit reporting company's investigation,Inadequate help over the phone,"I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and Veteran. I am applying for a VA loan. However, my estranged husband abused my credit, changing my credit from excellent to poor. XXXX of his accounts is incorrectly listed on my credit report. I filed a dispute to remove an erroneous account from my credit report. The credit provider, XXXX XXXX, provided evidence the account does not belong to me, then proceeded to delete it from my XXXX file, Transunion file, and XXXX file. XXXX and XXXX updated my report immediately. However, Transunion refuses to remove it because they tell me they have 30 days to resolve the dispute. After speaking with XXXX other employees, I was transferred to a supervisor by the name of XXXX, then to his supervisor XXXX, then to her supervisor XXXX. All XXXX employees subordinate to XXXX verified the evidence from XXXX was in my file, XXXX, however said it was not there. I asked to speak to her supervisor, but she refused. Ultimately she offered a 48hr call back, then hung up on me when I asked to speak to that person 's supervisor. 

I called back, spoke with XXXX before who transferred me to XXXX. I told XXXX the situation and that I am in process of filing a complaint with the FTC and a congressional inquiry. I asked for the name of the supervisor in-charge of the special handling division. After putting me on hold, she said she was unable to give out that information. I tried to find the information online, but was unable. The bottom line is, the erroneous account belongs to my husband. It is preventing me from getting a VA home loan. My husband abused my credit cards, which caused my excellent credit to be damaged. But the biggest issue precluding the loan is the account in my husband 's name. Transunion has a policy wherein, if multiple disputes are being investigated, they will not update the account until they resolve all the disputes even though the disputes have nothing to do with XXXX another. I would like a remedy in the form of this erroneous account being taken off my report.

8/22/18,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"We have reached out to Freedom Mortgage several times regarding the Private Mortgage Insurance placed on our mortgage loan. Every call has been recorded according to their disclosure with the initiation of our conversation. Our current Loan to Original Value Ratio is 78.8 %. We have had two conversations with their mortgage brokers where we were told that we could send a letter to request the  removal of the PMI, but it really wasn't necessary because it will drop off in "" XXXX '', which is in 2 months. So we sent the letter and was told that we have to have another appraisal. This costs {$500.00}. Our thought process is why should we have another appraisal when we have two months left? We can use this money toward our principal. Well after several more conversations : XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with ID # XXXX and was disconnected. I called back and spoke with XXXX @ XXXX on a recorded line. I was told "" qualifies for PMI removal scheduled to drop off by self. '' Loan meets 2 requirement. Then he stated we had to be @ 75 %. 
They are not providing a logical reason to us that makes sense for why we are still having to pay PMI. Our original disclosure statement for PMI states that the PMI will automatically terminate when it reaches 78 % .They have this date scheduled.

4/29/16,Credit card,,Closing/Cancelling account,,"Summary : Discover Card closes account on first-class, long-term customer with excellent FICO score, for simply having "" inactivity '' on account. 

I have had my Discover Card in question since 1995 ( 21 years ). I not only have an excellent history directly with Discover, but also have a very high FICO score which recently ranges from XXXX to XXXX ( with XXXX max ). On or about XXXX XXXX, I received a letter from Discover informing me that my account was suspended and would be closed within 30 days. The letter states that the closure was due to "" Inactivity on your account. '' I then tried to use my credit card for a purchase, but the card was denied in the system, per the merchant. On XXXX XXXX and on XXXX XXXX, I spoke to a Supervisor using the card 's normal customer service phone number ; neither could assist to re-instate the card. 

Through online research conducted on my own, I found that Discover had a department called the "" Executive Office of Customer Advocacy. '' I thought this dept would handle my concern in a more "" independent '' manner, but I was mistaken. My assigned rep in this dept was XXXX XXXX. I explained to XXXX XXXX, that I thought I was being treated in an unjust manner as a long-term customer of Discover. For someone to have their account closed without any recourse, for simply not having any recent activity seemed unfair and silly. This has happened before, with other credit cards I own, and with all other credit card companies they have immediately allowed the card to be re-instated. 

One of my major concerns is that Discover 's action to close my account actually hurts my excellent credit score/history. This was not only explained in detail to the two supervisors that I had conversation with, but also with XXXX XXXX. By closing my account with 21 active years, this hurts the "" length of credit history '' aspect of my credit score. Also, by closing my account with a credit limit of {$12000.00} this also hurts my credit score ; because a person 's total amount owed ( on all accounts ) is compared to your overall credit limits on hand. The two supervisors and XXXX XXXX, danced around this issue, and said they could not answer to this concern because they were not a "" credit analyst. '' This is very basic credit/FICO information, and knowledge that anyone in their ( elevated ) positions should understand. ( The irony is that Discover 's widely advertised free ability to show MY credit score on my statement, will now reflect a lower credit score, due to them. ) XXXX XXXX promised to call me back within a short period of time. She never did. In my initial call with her, I explicitly informed her that it was OK to leave a voice mail. After about 13 days or so, I called her and she said that she had attempted to call me. I do not believe she was being honest with me. She then told me over the phone that Discover could not re-instate my account, and that she also sent me a letter stating the same. I had various questions for XXXX XXXX, but instead she gave me vague answers. Most of her responses had little to no connection to the actual questions I was asking. Instead of talking to me as a human being, she danced around the entire topic and conducted herself more like a high-class lawyer. This was a huge disappointment to me. 

In conclusion, I am just shocked that Discover Card would treat a customer in this fashion. There is nothing "" negative '' that I have done wrong. Actually, in my opinion, I would describe the way I have conducted my financial affairs throughout my entire life as near-perfect. I have always treated my credit history and score in a very serious manner. Most credit card companies desire to find and hold customers with excellent credit, but instead Discover rejects individuals like me. For Discover to hurt me and others for simple "" inactivity on account '' seems to be not only unfair, but unethical and unprofessional.",,DISCOVER BANK,CA,917XX,,Consent provided,Web,4/29/16,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1901776

At this point I called customer service at Discover to find out how much I needed to pay to avoid paying any further interest fees and was told they had no way of knowing. The customer service representative said to call back next month ( after another month of accruing interest ) to find out how much I would need to pay to eliminate the balance subject to interest.

However, there were discrepancies on the monthly payment and I was not receiving the statement from the bank for the exact amount. Therefore, I was shocked when I reviewed my credit report and found late payment on the dates below : From XX/XX/XXXX - to XX/XX/XXXX - Please remove those late payments!
