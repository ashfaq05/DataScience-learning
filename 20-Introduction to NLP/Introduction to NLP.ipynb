    "\n",
    "NLP or Natural Language Processing as is normally referred to, refers to working (or processing) **text data**, either for machine learning, or any of the host of usecases textual data comprises of. Working with text, is very different from working with numerical or categorical data. We have worked extensively with data, numerical, categorical and boolean, however text data is a different paradigm altogether and this tutorial aims to get you acquanited with the basics of working with text and understanding the underlying implications in Machine learning.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Let us get started with the introduction to natural language processing by first looking at the problem that we are going to solve. We have a rich dataset of consumer complaints on various financial products and services. Each row in the dataset describes the complaint and the different features associated with it. In this concept, we'll first construct the features and then build a model that predicts the category into which the complaint falls. You can read more about this dataset [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database).\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with the complaint narrative, the other features that are present in data are the issue, the category of the complaint, the date it was received on, the zip code, details of the customer placing the complaint and the current status of the complaint. The final idea is to build a model that will categorize each customer's complaint into a product (12 categories in all). \n",
    "\n",

    "At the end of the previous exercise we saw that the data contained in the consumer complaint narrative column is a **paragraph**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a typical example of text data - words combine to form sentences, and sentences combine to form paragraphs. The column `Consumer complaint narrative` has all rows in the form of either NaNs or text data. How do we make sense of this data?\n",
    "Do we convert this to categorical format through one-hot encoding? If yes, how do we do it?\n",
    "How do we convert the text data to a numerical format to make sure machine learning algorithms can be applied?\n",
    "Can this column be used in a multinomial classification model to predict the class of the complaint?\n",
    "\n",
    "All these questions (and more) can be answered through a branch of Artificial Intelligence. Enter **Natural Language Processing.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, Natural Language Processing or NLP is defined as the application of computational techniques for the analysis and the synthesis of text. The aim of NLP is to give computers the ability to do tasks involving human language. In terms of hands-on or engineering terms, it can broadly be defined as \"cleaning\" and \"transforming\" text to a form fit for machine learning. Of course, you can derive insights from text as well just like any EDA operation. But the inherent properties of text call for a principally different approach to deal with it. This leads us to an important question of why is to so hard to deal with text that it requires a separate field of study.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why is it difficult to work with text?\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Comprehending Language is hard for computers. Some of the unique challenges of working with text are as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Synonymy** - This corresponds to different words having the same meaning. A similar intent can be conveyed in various ways and this is one of the prime reasons, why computers have a hard time deciphering the meaning or intent of those statements. \"The President of United States has signed a new decree\" and \"POTUS has inked in a new law\" are basically advocating the same sentiment. However as they are completely different sentences syntactically, computers have a hard time figuring out the user intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ambiguity** - \"The bank deposit rate is quite high\" and \"He stood near the bank admiring the river\". In these statements, the word `bank` has completely different meanings. In the first case it represents a financial institution, and in the second case it refers to land near the river. Disambiguating the meaning in sentences is quite challenging.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Anaphora Resolution** - \"George is my friend. He likes football\". In the second statement `he` refers to George. It is difficult for the computers to discern what person/entity the pronoun `he` is referring to.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Language related issues** - Every language has its own uniqueness. For English we have words, sentences, paragraphs and so on. But in Thai, there is no concept of sentences at all! The grammar and morphology of languages is so different. This is why we observe that Google Translator or any other translator service struggles to perfectly convert a piece of text from one language to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Out of Vocabulary problem** - Machines have a hard time adapting to any new constructs that humans come up with. As humans when we come across a word we haven't seen earlier, we might not understand its meaning instantly. But this does not mean we cannot adapt. After looking at the word in several different sentences and understanding its usage, we understand the context and meaning of the new word. Machines can only handle data that they have seen before. It is unable to adapt well.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Language generation** - While language understanding is hard, language generation too has its own set of challenges. For chatbots to work effectively, they need to communication properly constructed sentences which are grammatically correct. This is quite a hard problem and a challenge that needs to be overcome. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We now know that working with text is hard. But there are also exciting applications and use cases involved with working on text. We will now take a look at some of the use cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Usecases of NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "The usecases of NLP encompass almost anything you can do with Language in relation to a problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Sentiment Analysis** - Finding if the text is leaning towards a positive or negative sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially in order to determine whether the writer's attitude towards a particular topic, product, etc. is positive, negative, or neutral is called Sentiment Analysis. The information present over the Internet is constantly growing resulting in a large number of texts expressing opinions in review sites, forums, blogs and different social media forums. Sentiment analysis is therefore a topic of great interest and development since it has many practical applications. It is immensely useful in figuring the overall sentiment of products (Amazon), movies (Netflix), food (Yelp),etc. Its applications include Market Research, Social Monitoring, Customer Support and Product Analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Text Classification** - Categorizing text to various categories\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Text classifiers can be used to organize, structure, and categorize almost any text data we have. For e.g. New articles can be organized by topics, chat conversations can be organized by language, support tickets can be organized by urgency etc. Other examples of text classification include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Directing customer queries to the right vertical\n",
    "\n",
    "- Detection of spam and non-spam emails,\n",
    "\n",
    "- Auto tagging of customer queries\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Document Summarization** - Compressing a paragraph/document into few words or sentences\n",
    "\n",
    "Text summarization is the method of compressing a text document, in order to create a summary of the major points of the document. The idea of summarization is to find a subset of data which contains the `information` of the entire set. It's applications include News summary(Inshorts app), Novel Summary, Book Summary (Blinkist) etc. With the overall attention span declining, the need to provide information in the shortest possible words has risen - and summarization helps solve this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) **Parts of Speech Tagging** - Figuring out the various nouns, adverbs, verbs etc in the text\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying part of speech tags is much more complicated than it looks. This is because over time in the development of language, a single word can have different parts of speech tag in different sentences based on different contexts. This makes it impossible to have a generic mapping for POS tags. Few of its applications include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text to speech conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "- Word Sense Disambiguation (Teach machine to know the difference of the meaning of word 'bears' in \"I saw a couple of bears\" and \"Hard work always bears fruit\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5) **Machine translation** - Translate text from one language to another\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Translation is the task of automatically translating one natural language into another while retaining the meaning of the original text. Translation from one language to another is complex because some of the words in the original language could have multiple meanings and these words could have different forms in the output language. \n",
    "Its most popular application is Google Translate and it is employed in devices like Google Home as well. Machine translation allows business transactions between partners in different countries without the need of a human interpreter. \n",
    "\n",
    "6) **Named Entity Recognition** - Identify the entities present in text\n",
    "\n",
    "Named Entity Recognition deals with named entity mentions in text and categorizes these entities into person, organization, datetime reference etc. This is used a lot in the field of bioinformatics, molecular biology and other medical NLP applications. It also plays an important role in the overall field of Information Extraction where we try to extract knowledge from unstructured text. \n",
    "\n",
    "7) **Conversational AI** - Chat with a machine in natural language and get queries resolved\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversational AI deals with creating an interface between machines and humans to converse in natural language. Such interfaces are known as chatbots. A user can interact in natural language with natural language, the same way he usually communicates with a human. For organizations to truly scale in terms of customer support, chatbots are increasingly adopted as the first point of contact for customer query resolution across all organizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So for enabling all the NLP usecases, the first challenge is to convert the text into a form that the machine can understand. For that, we need to arrive at a fundamental component of text known as `tokens`. "

    "## 1.3: Tokenization \n",

    "\n",
    "### Motivation for tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that unlike all the machine learning datasets we have worked with previously, the data isn't boolean, numeric, categorical etc. Usually a text is composed of paragraphs, paragraphs are composed of sentences, and sentences are composed of words. You could also go deeper into letters, but the letters have no meaning. It's only when they are combined into words, that the text starts to make sense. Hence, it is better to work at the word level. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tokenization is the process of splitting the text into smaller parts called tokens. Tokens are the basic units of a particular dataset. The choice of tokens could be based on the application we are working on. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction to NLTK\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Tool Kit/NLTK is the standard library in python which specifically deals with text. All the text processing tasks could be easily done with this library. It is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. It also provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning, wrappers for industrial-strength NLP libraries, along with an active discussion forum. On top of it, it is completely free and open-source with a vibrant developer community supporting it. Let us now take the first step towards categorizing the consumer complaints by starting with tokenization.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Tokenizing with NLTK - The problem intuition \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first need to find a way to convert the text to numbers to get them to a form where you would be able to apply an algorithm to this. Think of this like sklearn, which require all non-numeric data to be encoded (label or one-hot) prior to the sklearn pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, it would make sense to divide each paragraph of text to its basic form (words) and then convert each of those words to numbers. We could assign a particular number to each word, in which case a sentence could look like a set of numbers to us, each number representing a particular word. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step to achieving that would be to break the text down to words. That's what tokenization aims to do. NLTK has a built in libraries for tokenization which we will use for our purpose. "

    "To split into definite sentences, it is compulsory to identify the end and beginning of sentences. In case if sentences ending with **!** and  **?**, it is quite clear that they signal the end of a sentence; and consequently the next word is the start of a new sentence. But **periods (.)** are ambiguous. This is because periods can be used for:\n",

    "- Abbreviations (ex: Dr. Mr. etc.)\n",

    "So how to identify periods which actually signify sentence boundaries? Some of the common ways to address this issue are:\n",
    "- Use handwritten rules. For ex: If there is a word starting with \"An\" after a period then it is a sentence boundary\n",
    "- A classical way is to use regular expressions \n",

    "The importance of converting words to lower case - All words should be converted to lowercase while doing NLP. The reason behind being, that \"Yorkshire\" and \"yorkshire\" even though are the same word, will be considered 2 separate words while converting the words into numbers. Since both of them represent the same word, it would lead to redundant features. Most of the classifiers assume that the features are independent of each other. To avoid such issues, it is standard practice to convert all words or text to lower case, before beginning NLP.\n",

    "It is important to realize that count vectorizer is essentially a Ranking algorithm, in the way that it gives a higher weight to words which have appeared more number of times. In other words, the key_value pair is nothing but the count of the words in the dataset. It does not assign any importance to the order in which the words have appeared in the sentences. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another point to be considered is the fact that words like \"a\",\"an\",\"the\" etc. will appear more number of times than the rest of the words as they are common articles. Using a Count vectorizer out of the box on a paragraph or a body of text will invariably give the highest count to these common words. Hence the words we are actually interested in will be underneath these words. One way to rectify this, is to remove these commonly occurring words. NLTK offers this functionality and has rightly defined these particular words as \"stopwords\" or words we wouldn't include in our bag of words. We will have to remove the punctuation as well, as you can see that our initial bag of words had the commas, full-stops and all of the other symbols as well. We will have to remove them as well, to avoid being vectorized. \n",

    "### 3.1 Introduction to TF-IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last tutorial we saw how text was converted to numerics using a count vectorizer. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, a count vectorizer, counts the occurences of the words in a document and all the documents are considered independent of each other. Very similar to a one hot encoding or pandas getdummies function. However in cases where multiple documents are involved, count vectorizer still does not assume any interdependence between the documents and considers each of the documents as a seperate entity. \n",
    "\n",
    "It does not rank the words based on their importance in the document, but just based on whether they exist or not. This is not a wrong approach, but it intuitively makes more sense to rank words based on their importance in the document right? In fact, the process of converting, text to numbers should essentially be a ranking system of the words so that the documents can each get a score based on what words they contain. All words cannot have the same imprtance or relevance in the document right?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to approach document similarity:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. TF-IDF Score\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Cosine Similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at them one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TF-IDF!!\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF or Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency is kind of the holy grail of ranking metrics to convert text to numbers. Consider the count vectorizer as a metric which just counts the occurences of words in a document. \n",
    "\n",
    "** The ranking system in a count vectorizer is purely occurence based on a single document only!**\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF takes it a step further and ranks the words based not just on their occurences in one document but across all the documents. Hence if CV or Count vectorizer was giving more importance to words because they have appeared multiple times in the document, TF-IDF will rank them high if they have appeared only in that document, meaning that they are rare, hence higher importance and lower if they have appeared in all or most documents, because they are more common, hence lower ranking. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a scenario where there are 5 documents and all are talking aout football. The word football would have appeared multiple times in each document. CV is going to rank football consistently high and infact give the word football a different value across all 5 documents based on how many times that word has appeared in that document. In other words, it is assuming, that the more number of times a word appears, the more important it is. That is exactly what the TF or the Term Frequency component in TF-IDF does. \n",
    "\n",
    "IDF on the other hand now is the dominating factor in TFIDF which is going to find out the number of times football has also appeared in the other 4 documents except for the one it is currently seeing. If football has also appeared in rest of the documents, it means that though football is important to that one document based on the number of occurences, considering it has appeared in the rest as well, it is not that rare or more common, hence the importance now is going to reduce instead of going high!\n",
    "\n",
    "**The ranking system is across the entire corpus or all documents.  It is not a single document based metric!**\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen how CV is calculated for a word in a document. Let us now see how TF IDF is...\n",
    "\n",
    "The tf-idf weight is composed by two terms: the first computes the normalized Term Frequency (TF), aka. the number of times a word appears in a document, divided by the total number of words in that document; the second term is the Inverse Document Frequency (IDF), computed as the logarithm of the number of the documents in the corpus divided by the number of documents where the specific term appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "TF: Term Frequency, which measures how frequently a term occurs in a document. Since every document is different in length, it is possible that a term would appear much more times in long documents than shorter ones. Thus, the term frequency is often divided by the document length (aka. the total number of terms in the document) as a way of normalization: \n",
    "\n",
    "TF(t) = (Number of times term t appears in a document) / (Total number of terms in the document).\n",
    "\n",
    "IDF: Inverse Document Frequency, which measures how important a term is. While computing TF, all terms are considered equally important. However it is known that certain terms, such as \"is\", \"of\", and \"that\", may appear a lot of times but have little importance. Thus we need to weigh down the frequent terms while scale up the rare ones, by computing the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "IDF(t) = log_e(Total number of documents / Number of documents with term t in it).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a document containing 100 words wherein the word cat appears 3 times. The term frequency (i.e., tf) for cat is then (3 / 100) = 0.03. Now, assume we have 10 million documents and the word cat appears in one thousand of these. Then, the inverse document frequency (i.e., idf) is calculated as log(10,000,000 / 1,000) = 4. Thus, the Tf-idf weight is the product of these quantities: 0.03 * 4 = 0.12.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python Implementation of TF-IDF**\n",
    "Let us now take the first 3 complaints and run a TF-IDF vectorizer on the same. So, in this case, the 3 complaints are our 3 documents. and instead of a CV which considers each document independent of each other and just calculates the count of every word in the document. now the corpus will be the sum total of both documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "complaint_1 = data[\"X\"].iloc[0]\n",
    "complaint_2 = data[\"X\"].iloc[1]\n",

    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes classifier is a linear classifier based on the Bayes' theorem. The term naive comes from the assumption of considering all features in a dataset are mutually independent. The independent assumption is generally violated in real datasets, but the naive Bayes Classifier still tends to perform very well.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a document d and class c, it is defined as:\n",
    "$P(c|d)$ is the probability of a document d belonging to class c. Or in other words, given the content of the document, what is the probability that it belongs to class c?\n",
    "\n",
    "On applying Bayes rule, we get\n",
    "\n",
    "$posterior = \\frac{prior\\ \\times\\ conditional\\ probability}{evidence}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "$P(c|d)= \\frac{P(d|c).P(c)}{P(d)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "P(d|c) means the probability of observing the document d given that it belongs to class c. If we consider the document to be represented by the words, and we assume the words to be independent of each other. Then\n",
    "$P(d|c) = \\prod_{i=1}^n P(w_i|c)$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, it can be interpreted as the probability of observing the word $w_i$ in the document, given that it belongs to class c. Since all probabilities will have P(d) as their denominator, we can eliminate the denominator.\n",
    "Resulting in the following formula\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(c|d) = P(d|c) \\times P(c) = \\prod_{i=1}^n P(w_i|c) \\times P(c) $ \n",
    "\n",
    "Being easy to implement and fast, naive Bayes classifiers are used in many different fields including classification of RNA sequences and spam filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's understand it better with an example of spam filtering: \n",
    "\n",
    "For a spam classification problem, we have two classes - `ham` and `spam` (ham means not spam). Given any email, we need to find P(ham|email) and P(spam|email). Whichever probability is higher - we assign that label to the email. Consider, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(spam|email)= P(email|spam) \\times P(spam)$$\n",

    "Let us take a word `lottery` for example that is present in the text of the email.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(lottery|spam) = \\frac{\\text{number of times lottery appears in spam email}}{\\text{sum of number of times all words of vocabulary appear in spam email}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, the word `lottery` would appear more in spam emails than in the ham emails, and overall increases the probability that email is spam. For all the words we choose as features, we calculate the above probability and aggregate it to get probability of observing the email. If P(spam|email) > P(ham|email), we allocate the label `spam` to the email or `ham` otherwise.  \n",

Since a classification algorithm tends to predict the majority class unless, the output categories are more or less equally balanced, the error in predicting the majority class will increase as it classifies more and more data, and classifies them wrong, hence reducing the overall accuracy. \n",
