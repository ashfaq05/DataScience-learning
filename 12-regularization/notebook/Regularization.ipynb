    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "The bivariate linear regression model can be expressed as  $\\mathbf{y} = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 \\mathbf{x}$ . You can estimate the value of the regression parameters ( $\\theta_0$  and  $\\theta_1$ ) using the Ordinary Least Squares(OLS) method of optimization. However, there is another method very widely used for estimating these parameters which is known as **Gradient Descent**. But before getting into the nuts and bolts of this method lets understand why we need gradient descent in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Gradient Descent when we already have OLS?**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few reasons why algorithms like gradient descent are preferred over OLS for parameter estimation.\n",
    "- The OLS method is an expensive process as it involves matrix inversion. As the amount of data increases, this operation becomes more complex (algorithmic complexity is $O(n^3$)) and hence it scales poorly\n",
    "- Most non-linear trends do not have a closed form solution where OLS will fail to find parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition of gradient descent**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the below image: <img src='../images/intuition.jpg' width=600>\n",
    "\n",
    "These three pictures represent three different situations where a ball is placed in a glass bowl at three separate positions. It is a known fact that the force of gravity will pull the ball towards the bottom of the bowl.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **situation 1**, the ball will move from position b1 to c1 and not a1. This ball will continue to travel till it reaches the bottom of the bowl. In situation 2, since the static ball is already at the bottom it will stay at b2 and it won’t move at all. In general, **the ball always tries to move from a higher potential energy state to a lower state**. Gravity is responsible for these different potential energy states of the ball.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how is this similar to gradient descent optimization? Actually, this is exactly how gradient descent optimization works. **The only major difference is that gradient descent optimization tries to minimize a loss function instead of potential energy**. (If you remember the loss function in OLS was minimizing the sum of squared residuals)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, lets understand how the ball will roll down when it is placed in situation 1 and why does it so. In terms of the coordinate system, the potential energy reduces as the ball rolls down the Z-axis (vertical axis). The ball tries to modify its position on the X and Y-axes to determine the lowest possible potential energy or the minimum possible value on the z-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='../images/situation.jpg' width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient descent optimization can be thought of as a process similar to the rolling example in the following manner:\n",
    "- **Z-axis can be considered as the loss function**\n",
    "- **X &  Y-axes are the coefficients of the model** \n",
    "- **Loss function is equivalent to the potential energy of the ball in the bowl**\n",
    "- **Idea is to minimize loss function by adjusting X & Y-axes (i.e coefficients of the model)**"

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Impact of learning rate**\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning rate is the amount by which you move down in the direction of decreasing cost denoted usually by $\\alpha$. If $\\alpha$ is too big, then there might be a possibility to overshoot the minima. On the other hand on choosing a smaller learning rate the learning algorithm might take too much time to learn from the data which will make our model slower. So, choosing a **good** learning rate which reaches the lowest cost swiftly is of prime importance with an iterative approach like gradient descent.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Scaling in gradient descent**\n",
    "\n",
    "You must be thinking what role does the scale of features play in gradient descent? From the previous sections we have the weight update rule for batch gradient descent as : \n",
    "$$\\theta_j = \\theta_j - \\alpha.(h_\\theta(x) - y)).x_j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe that updates are dependent on the feature magnitude $x_j$. If all the features are not on the same scale, this might lead to some weights getting updated faster than others; slowing down the entire process of gradient descent. The way to tackle this obstacle would be normalizing the features which will give us an even contour to navigate and we can find the best set of model parameters pretty quickly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets take a situation with two features having coefficients $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ and cost $J(\\theta)$. In case of unscaled features, we have the contour with an elliptical/oval shape. This shape makes it very difficult for the model to arrive at the optimum $\\theta$s and takes a long time to do so. <img src='../images/without.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon normalizing the features, we obtain a more even contour and the model can quickly arrive at the best set of model parameters ($\\theta$s) in lesser time as compared with the situation with non-normalized features. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initializing model parameters**\n",
    "\n",
    "Weight/parameter initialization is a key step in gradient descent. This is because a close initial guess can lead to faster convergence and a bad guess can lead to a much longer time. It is almost like shooting a target in the dark. Only with domain expertise one can have an approximation for the model parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mini-batch Gradient Descent**\n",
    "\n",
    "Till now you have come across two variants of gradient descent: Batch and Stochastic. There is another very useful variant which falls somewhere between them is the **Mini-Batch** variant. Here, instead of iterating over all training examples or a single training example, we process n training examples at once. This is a good choice for very large data sets. For example we can take 16, 32, 128 etc as the sample size of the mini-batch for training. "

But what if during visual inspection of relationships (take a scatter plot) you observe that the relationship is not actually linear but of some other type. Apart from that multicollinearity may also exist between predictor variables. In such a case the model becomes highly unstable and small changes to the data can cause large changes to the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, during the inspection of residuals if you try to fit a linear model to curved data, a scatter plot of residuals (Y axis) on the predictor (X axis) has patches of many positive residuals in the middle, and patches of negative residuals at either end (or vice versa).  This is a good sign that a linear model is not appropriate, and a polynomial may do better. Here rises the need for polynomial features. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Polynomial function**\n",

    "In statistics, polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable `x` and the dependent variable `y` is modelled as an $n$th degree polynomial in `x`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The equation is $y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x + \\beta_2x^2 + \\beta_3x^3 + .... + \\beta_nx^n$\n",

Expected predictions mean that you are averaging the predictions of the model (if you repeat the entire model building process on new random data multiple times). Due to the inherent randomness in the data there is bound to be a range for predictions. Bias measures how far off are the predictions from the true values. Bias error arises due to incorrect assumptions in our learning algorithm which makes it hard to learn true relationships between independent and dependent variables.\n",

Each hit represents an individual realization of our model, given the chance variability in the training data we gather. Sometimes we will get a good distribution of training data so we predict very well and we are close to the bulls-eye, while sometimes our training data might be full of outliers or non-standard values resulting in poorer predictions.

The bias increases because you are having too many restrictions by reducing the number of features. So, while we try to reduce the variance bias increases and vice-versa.

As a result, it will fare poorly during the prediction phase as well. **And obviously the test set error will be bad since the model hasn't learnt properly.

    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in datasets. It does so by reducing the magnitude of the coefficients of the attributes. More is the magnitude of the co-efficient, more is its predictive power. But a very high magnitude of co-efficent/s mean that the learning algorithm has modeled the pattern as well as the noise. This noise can be eliminated by regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does regularization reduce noise?**\n",
    "\n",
    "As written above, regularization reduces noise. But how? Simply by penalizing the co-efficients according to some function along with the loss function. Lets see how.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost function for linear regression is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$J(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2m}\\sum_{i=1}^{m}(h_\\theta(x_i)-y_i)^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "You penalize your loss function by adding a multiple of the norm of your weights/co-efficients vector  $w$  (it is the vector of the learned parameters in your linear regression). You get the following equation:  $$J(\\theta) = L(x,y)+λN(\\theta_i)$$ where $L(x,y)$ is the cost function and $N(w_i)$ is the norm of the coefficients and $\\lambda$ is a constant called the regularization parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition behind regularization**\n",
    "\n",
    "More is the cost function, the more it is penalized i.e. more is the magnitude of the coefficients, more the function penalized. In this way it reduces the importance given to the predictor variables which results in decreased variance. This makes sure that the algorithm doesn't learn too much from the training data and generalizes well on unseen data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another factor that we have not yet talked about is that the computational resources used up is directly proportional to the number of features. If it becomes too huge, then calculation could become cumbersome and regularization at that point can be an effective method to counter the issue."

    "\n",
    "After model selection comes the part of selecting the best possible set of hyperparamteres. This is the  process of hyperparameter tuning where we find the combination of hyperparameter values for a machine learning model that performs the best on a validation dataset. Hyperparameters can be thought of as model settings which need to be tuned for each problem because the best model hyperparameters for one particular dataset will not be the best across all datasets. \n",

    "\n",
    "- **Grid search:** As the name itself suggests, it evaluates every possible combination of hyperparameters from a grid and picks up the best combination. In our example it means we are selecting a bunch of values for $\\lambda$ i.e. $\\lambda_1$, $\\lambda_2$, $\\lambda_3$, ...., $\\lambda_n$ and evaluate our model on the validation set for each of these values and later return the best $\\lambda$.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Random search:** Random search is a slight variation on grid search. Instead of searching over the entire grid, random search only evaluates a random sample of points on the grid. This makes random search a lot cheaper than grid search. With our example of finding the best $\\lambda$, we can simply define a range $[\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2]$ and leave it to random search where it will find randomly select values for $\\lambda$ within this range and return the one with the best performance on validation set. \n",
