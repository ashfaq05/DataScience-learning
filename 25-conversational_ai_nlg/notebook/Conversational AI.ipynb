    "## 1.1 What is NLG\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the last few modules, we have talked about how NLP helps us solve the problem of having machines comprehend human languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "NLP is broadly defined as the machine's ability to take natural languages as input, tokenize it, understand its meaning and determine appropriate action to respond back. At a very high level though we can split NLP into four different subsections: \n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/NLP_2.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "**Speech recognition**\n",
    "\n",
    "The input phase of NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "It involves all the methods of taking input as speech and converting them to text for further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Natural language understanding (NLU):**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a subset of NLP that deals with machine's reading comprehension. \n",
    "\n",
    "It deals with how to best handle unstructured inputs and convert them into a structured form that a machine can understand and act upon. This sounds easy as we humans are able to effortlessly handle mispronunciations or swapped words but machines are less adept at handling such random inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put simply this is the task of to optimise machine's ability to understand what we say.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rerouting an email to the right person based on a the content\n",
    "\n",
    "- Showing resturant options based on our search command \"I am in the mood to eat Italian food\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Natural language generation (NLG):**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a subfield of NLP  that focuses on computer systems that can produce understandable texts in human languages. NLG processes turn structured data into text.\n",
    "\n",
    "If NLU deals with the reading of the text, you can understand NLG as dealing with the writing of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "This subfield is going to be the focus throughout this module.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Speech synthesis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The output phase of NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the methods which speak or read out text.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "Usually NLP problems involve solving problem across a single subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though there are NLP applications that combine different subsets. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, speech-to-speech applications(Apple’s Siri, Amazon's Alexa) use all the above types of NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, this module is going to majorly talk about NLG.\n",
    "\n",
    "The major question before we proceed is what's the need for NLG.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Need for NLG**\n",
    "\n",
    "Humans have needed data in order to formulate new ideas and communicate them. However, with the rise of big data, there is a major influx of data that needs to be assessed along with the need to reduce costs significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of NLG is the ability to convert the dataset into legible narratives understood by humans. While NLP can only assess text to give us insights, NLG can be used to process statistical data present in spreadsheets and produce data-rich information. With smart automation of routine tasks that NLG provides, humans can focus on more creative activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "For e.g:  The Associated Press used the report-generating capability of NLG to develop reports from their data. This resulted in freeing up of human reporters who were spending time energy going through the data to write a report. Instead, as NLG automatically produced thousands of reports, they invested their human resources to perform the more critical tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above mentioned use case is pretty much the essence of NLG. Automating routine tasks that humans spend energy and time wasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "To truly see NLG's potential, let's look at some exciting applications in which NLG is used\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications of NLG:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Auto Response Aids:\n",
    "\n",
    "NLG can be employed to produce routine factual sections of a document (which humans find monotonous to write), leaving analytical and explanatory sections to the human author.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples include automated personal replies to customer queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: ALETHGEN helps customer-service representatives write response letters to customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Summary generations\n",
    "\n",
    "Many experimental NLG systems have been developed to help summarise the data for further use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples include summarising weather data from news articles, providing hospital patients\n",
    "explanations of information in their patient records.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chatbots/ Personal Assistants\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most popular use of NLG is its application to create chatbots capable of answering queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "A chatbot refers to artificial intelligence software that can simulate a conversation (or chat) with a user in natural language through messaging applications, websites, mobile apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "[Wysa](https://www.wysa.io/) is an AI powered chatbot that acts as your health coach.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Collect Chat](https://collect.chat/) is another chatbot that attempts to replace the web forms(data) with an interactive method\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Lot of online services are also enabling chatbots to act as first level of customer queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Miscellaneous\n",
    "\n",
    "Lot of experimental systems have been explored for different practical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Marketing: The DYD system(van Deemter and Odijk) was made to generate descriptions of a music CD which are intended to increase interest in and sales of that CD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behaviour Change: The STOP system(Reiter, Robertson, and Osman) was made to generate personalised letters which encourage people to stop smoking\n",
    "\n",
    "Entertainment: The JAPE system(Binstead and Ritchie) was made to generate jokes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "NLG systems are capable for much more \n",
    "\n",
    "To be really successful though we need to have systems that need to embody models. For instance, to make a behaviour chatbot, we need to have a proper model that explains how people break addictive habits\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently we do not have precise computational models in many of the areas NLG can be used for. This means that building effective NLG systems is also a research project in the computational modelling of human activities.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We just briefly discussed some of the exciting applications of NLG.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand NLG better, let's try to look broadly at the NLG architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, there is no agreement on the standard architecture model of NLG sysytem. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will look in detail, a specific architecture that has decomposition of the NLG process into distinct modules and one particular set of representations for the information that is passed between these modules. The architecture that we are going to discuss is not the only possible architecture for NLG systems, but it is similar to the architecture of a number of existing NLG systems, and it is broadly compatible with a wide range of work in the field.\n",

    "Consider we want to create a Weather Reporter Application using NLG. Following is the ideal weather summary we are looking for:\n",
    "\n",
    "`\"The month of March was warmer and drier than average, with an average number of rain and sunny days. The total rain for the year so far is just above average. There was rain on every day for five days from the 20th to the 25th, with fog patches on the 23rd and 24th. Rainfall amounts were mostly less, with strong dry winds.\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at each step in NLG one by one by examining the issues involved in generating the above summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "CONTENT DETERMINATION:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is essentially the task of deciding what information should be communicated in the output document. The choice of what content should be expressed in a text is dependent upon certain features including:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***Different communicative goals:*** \n",
    "\n",
    "For a same problem, it may require different information to be expressed depending upon the goal. \n",
    "\n",
    "For e.g. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a NLG weather system that is capable of both describing the current weather and also of providing definitions and explanations of meteorological phenomena, then different content will be required in each case. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Content Consumer**\n",
    "\n",
    "The content may also depend on assumed/known characteristics of the person who is going to consume the content. \n",
    "\n",
    "For e.g.: Suppose we make a chatbot for a query site like `stack overflow`. Depending on someone who is considered a novice in the domain of his query, they may require more explanatory information than someone who is considered an expert.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints**\n",
    "\n",
    "The constraints upon the output produced by machine will also play a role in determining the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "For e.g.: One of them could be is that it may be necessary that the text produced fits within a constrained space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Information Source**\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying source of information also plays an important role in determining what the content of the text should be. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with all the above points, the information to be included in a text are ultimately very application dependent. That's why it's not possible to specify general rules for content determination.\n",
    "\n",
    "For e.g. If we want to create a summary for a transportation logistics company that might look at the data and take appropriate action, the summary that should be put will involve how the weather is affecting the road and transport services.\n",

    "Business related news will have more numbers and statistics when compared with say, a news on the opening of a museum in the city.\n",

    "- Grouped according to information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Text may be grouped for presentation in terms of what the information is about.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the case of weather reporting summaries, all the information about rainfall may be collected in one paragraph and presented before another paragraph which presents all the information about the temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Grouped according to discourse relations\n",
    "\n",
    "Information may be presented in a way that indicates particular DISCOURSE RELATIONS between the text elements.\n",

    "For example, The weather summary might start with just the description of month's rainfall in general terms and then proceed to elaborate about the rainfall in detail. The second part of the text is therfore related to the first by means of a discourse relation of Elaboration.\n",

    "\n",
    "A chatbot is an application(web/mobile) that tries to gauge consumer’s queries and then assist them to perform the needed task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chatbots popular uses include: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Acting as customer support\n",
    "- Provide a medium to connect customers and their finances\n",
    "- Show booking information(flights,movies,etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check out the following sites to get a comprehensive list of available chatbots in the market \n",
    "\n",
    "- [There is a bot for that](https://thereisabotforthat.com/)\n",
    "- [Chatbottle](https://chatbottle.co/)\n",

    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Chatbots can be broadly divided into two categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rule Based Approach: \n",
    "\n",
    "The bot answers queries based on some specified rules. \n",
    "\n",
    "All the commands that the bot answers must be written separately using regular expressions or other forms of string analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a rule-based chatbot is a basic text messaging application like the ones that few shopping companies use to send coupon codes or offers. You might have recieved a text message that says “Summer Sale! Text SUMMER to 54321 to get 10% off coupon code.” How it works is when you send the word, “SUMMER,” the application looks at the word and recognizes it as a command. It simply then follows a rule that tells it to send back the coupon code you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though effective, it's too naive for other complex situations\n",
    "\n",
    "If you sent “I want the coupon” to that same chatbot, it would not understand what you wanted. If the user has asked a question without using a single keyword, the bot can not understand it and, as a rule, responds with messages like “Sorry, I didn't understand” or \"Sorry. Invalid text\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- Self- Learning Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the bots that use Machine Learning techniques. Instead of pre-defined answers, the robot responds with adequate suggestions on the topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "A self-learning chatbot is intelligent because it responds by collecting information from the user and presenting it in the most appropriate way to serve the user’s purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-Learning Approach is itself divided into two categories:\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 1. Retrieval Based\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval based chatbot retrieves the responses from a set of predefined responses and one heuristic is set up to pick an appropriate response based on the input and context. This heuristic could either be something very simple(rule-based expression match) or complex(ensemble of Machine Learning classifiers) depending on the situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval based bot is trained to rank the best response from a finite set of predefined responses. The responses are either manually entered or based on knowledge base of pre-existing information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For e.g. \n",
    "Q- What is the duration of Jet Airways Flight from Mumbai to New York?\n",
    "A-  16 hours\n",
    "\n",
    "These kind of systems can also be extended to integrate with 3rd Party systems as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "For e.g. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Where is my flight arriving?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: It’s on schedule and should land in 15 mins. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval based bots are the most common types of chatbots in the market today. One of the reasons for that is they allow developers and UX to control the experience and match it to the expectations of their customers. \n",
    "\n",
    "They provide brilliant results when used for goal-oriented tasks like customer support or lead generation & feedback. \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 2. Generative\n",
    "\n",
    "A generative model chatbot doesn’t use any sort of predefined repository. They learn from historical conversations to generate new replies for the user. Language models are used to generate new content and require no guidance from any management system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These bots can generate the answers on their own and there is no finite output.\n",
    "To generate that it uses something called seq2seq model which uses sequences to maintain all the previous context and then reply\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: Consider the following simple conversation:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/seq.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see how every new sequence becomes part of the updated dataset i.e. Sequences based on conversations are build in real time\n",
    "\n",
    "Research on generative chatbots has been a major area of research for its ability to be closest to humans during conversations. So far though, they haven't been as popular in the market as retrieval models.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can go through this video on [Conversational AI at scale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9Em87eXRvE)(till 23:00 mark) to have a better understanding of the two different self-learning chatbots.\n",

    "Following is the process involved by the chatbot in helping you:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- You find a shoe model you like and send the bot a message saying you want this shoe.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using NLP in the backend, the machine converts this plain text request into codified commands that it can understand.\n",

    "**Entity:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the user’s intent is only part of the problem. It is also important to extract relevant information from a user’s message, such as dates and places. This different required pieces of information is called entity and the process of extracting them is called entity recognition\n",

    "Consider the previous example again, we understood the aim as to find the day of week, but of which date? “Today” is the entity that will help us.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Actions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Its used to define any operation which is performed by the bot. It could be a reply or querying a database. \n",

    "**Stories:**\n",
