    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble modeling is a machine learning technique of combining multiple machine learning models to produce one optimal model . \n",
    "Though there exists many different techniques of it, at their core they all employ the same two methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Produce a cohort of predictions using simple ML algorithms.\n",
    "- Combine the predictions into one \"aggregated\" model.\n",

    "### Why ensemble modeling?\n",
    "In real world scenarios, generalizing on a dataset by a single model can be challenging. Some models will be able to capture one aspect of the data well while others will do well in capturing something else. Ensemble modeling provides us a with family of techniques that help reduce errors and make predictions where the final evaluation metrics(For eg: Accuracy) are better than they are for each of the individual models.\n",

    " \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Stacking\n",
    "\n",
    "`This technique involves combining multiple classification models via a meta-classifier i.e. instead of using trivial functions to aggregate the predictions , a model is trained to perform this aggregation.`\n",
    "\n",
    "![Stacking](..\\images\\stacking.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "`This technique involves a sequential process, where each subsequent model attempts to correct the errors of the previous model. More weight is given to examples that were misclassified by earlier rounds and then the final prediction is produced by combining the results using a weighted average approach.`\n",

    "Suppose you want to watch a movie of your favourite actor this weekend. His last two movies had been disappointing, so you decide to watch the movie based upon the ratings given by your three friends. \n",
    "The most obvious and intuitive way then would be to average out all the three ratings and make your decision.\n",

    "Similarly the most intuitive way to combine models is averaging out their indvidual predictions. \n",

    "##### Soft Voting vs Hard Voting\n",

    "$Error(x)=E[(y- F(x))^2]$    `#E(x)=avg(x)`\n",

    "$Error(X)$ can be further broken down into the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Error(x)=(E[F(x)]- y)^2  + E[(F(x)- E[F(x)])^2] + \\alpha$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which can also be written as:\n",

    "\n",
    " \n",
    "**Error due to Bias:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The error due to bias is taken as the difference between the expected (or average) prediction of our model and the correct value which we are trying to predict. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Error due to Variance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The error due to variance is taken as the variability of a model prediction for a given data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since both are errors, you would ideally want a model having both low bias and low variance\n",
    "\n",
    "However to achieve that is difficult and there is always a tradeoff between a modelâ€™s ability to minimize bias and variance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's understand that with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following data distibution\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/bv_1.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Following will be the model if we try to `reduce bias error`:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/bv_2.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Two things you can observe:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The model has overfit the data(The model has become super complex and has fitted even noise)\n",
    "\n",
    "* While reducing bias, the variance has increased\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, following will be the model if we try to `reduce variance error`:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/bv_3.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Two things you can observe:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The model has underfit the data(The model is too simple and has fitted the data too poorly)\n",
    "\n",
    "* While reducing variance, the bias has increased\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Your ideal model therefore becomes one having the perfect-bias variance tradeoff\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/bv_4.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As clear from the example, since a model can't be both less complex and more complex at the same time, there is no escaping the relationship between bias and variance in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Increasing in bias = decrease in variance. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Increasing in variance = decrease in bias.\n",

    "\n",
    "![](../images/bv_5.jpg)\n",
    "\n",

    "Another way to look at it is using the following diagram:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/bias_variance_tradeoff_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that the center of the target is a model that perfectly predicts the correct values. As we move away from the target, our predictions get worse and worse. \n",

    "\n",
    "High variance(low bias) algorithm train models that are accurate but inconsistent on average.\n",

    "Having both high variance and high bias results in the least optimum model which is both inconsistent and inaccurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bias-Variance Tradeoff in Bagging**\n",
    "\n",
    "In bagging, because of bootstrapping, each individual predictor has **a higher bias** than if it were trained on the original training set. However, a large number of such biases will get reduced when aggregated, hence the bias of the resulting bagging is only slightly higher than a comparable single predictor strong learner. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, because bagging provides a way to **reduce overfitting** owing to less dependence on one particular subset of training data, the **variance of resulting strong learner reduces** significantly.\n",
