a.55%
b.60%
c.66%
d.54%

7. Events A and B are independent if and only if

a. P(A and B) = P(A) P(B)
b. P(A | B) = P(A) P(B | A)
c. P(B | A) = P(A) P(B | A)
d. None of the above.

Ans: P(A and B) = P(A) P(B)




8. You are planning to play cricket today, but the morning is cloudy, 50% of all rainy days start off cloudy! But cloudy mornings are common about 40% of days start cloudy and this is usually a dry month only 10% tend to be rainy, what is the chance of rain during the day?

a. 0.215
b. 0.1556
c. 0.132
d. 0.125

Ans: 0.125






P(Rain) is Probability of Rain = 10%
P(Cloud|Rain) is Probability of Cloud, given that Rain happens = 50%
P(Cloud) is Probability of Cloud = 40%
P(Rain|Cloud) =  0.1 x 0.50.4   = .125
